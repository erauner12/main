One thing I've noticed is the power of allowing yourself to do itâ€”whether it's failing, succeeding, or just trying. After being at work for a long time, you realize that in some way, you're like a cog getting paid whether you're dragging your feet or sprinting. It's easy to let that be the case, but deep down, you know it doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel good to just get paid without doing what you know you can do.
You're often unwilling to try because you fear realizing you don't know everything. But that realization feels good. It feels good to acknowledge what you don't know. I don't want to spend my life pretending I know everything. When I need to come back down to earth and realize my limitations, let those be the times I do.
The reason I'm saying this now is that this is how I unblock myself at work. How do you unblock yourself in other areas of your life? Whether it's dating again or any personal goal, how do you move forward? You do it by putting forth the effort in relevant areas. When you put in that effort, regardless of success or failure, you're actually succeeding. It's a strange realization because succeeding involves failing and trying. It's all about allowing yourself to flow and try.
