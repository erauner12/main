- 09:19 The way you perceive yourself influences how others perceive you. #daily-record ^1725200369

While it's not a perfect correlation, it's essential to recognize that your self-image plays a significant role. ==For instance, the other day at Rabbit Hole, when you sat down at the table, I noticed that you exuded a certain shine or glow, even without saying a word==. This presence emanated from how you carried yourself, reflected in the look in your eyes, your posture, and the way you asked, "Can I sit down?"  
Ultimately, ==the way you view yourself sets the tone for how others will treat you, as they often respond to the energy you project==.
