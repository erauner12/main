While it's not a perfect correlation, it's essential to recognize that your self-image plays a significant role. For instance, the other day at Rabbit Hole, when you sat down at the table, I noticed that you exuded a certain shine or glow, even without saying a word. This presence emanated from how you carried yourself, reflected in the look in your eyes, your posture, and the way you asked, "Can I sit down?"
Ultimately, the way you view yourself sets the tone for how others will treat you, as they often respond to the energy you project.
