# Memo memos/1870
- 12:31 I've been thinking about why I felt better a few days ago. I was putting pressure on myself to be someone I didn't want to be, and no one else needed me to be either. To cope, I did what I usually do: glued my face to my computer and tried to work through #daily-record ^1727631080
 my feelings. This made my work seem more important because I was avoiding my real feelings.
After getting flustered, I went to Rachel's house. It felt weird when I saw her the day before; she didn't seem to want to talk to me. Maybe it was just how I was acting. There was friction between us, and going over probably wasn't the best decision, but it made me feel better. We both agreed that I should have been honest with myself and her months ago. Even though I enjoyed my time with her, I didn't really want to be with her.
Right now, I'm attracted to someone else, but that might not work out either. What matters most is the feeling of momentum I get when I stop trying to force things. If something is meant to happen, it will happen naturally. It's important to be clear and honest about your intentions and not get too attached to what you think should happen.
This idea applies not just in romantic relationships but also at work. Sometimes we think things need to be done a certain way, but that's not always true. Stand up for what you believe in, but don't feel entitled to have things go your way. If they don't, it's not a failure; it's part of the process.
I've made mistakes in relationships beforeâ€”pulled away from good ones and stayed in bad ones. Trying to prevent these mistakes by avoiding them doesn't work either; it blocks you from moving forward.
Even though my circumstances haven't changed, I'm glad I noticed what was happening. Realizing that I was getting too close to what I wanted things to be helped me feel better. She might still text me, but she may not feel the same way about me, and that's okay. What matters is enjoying our interactions without putting extra pressure on myself.
All we have is this moment and what happened in the past. Accepting both is the only way to truly find out what you actually want, even if you're not sure what that is yet.
