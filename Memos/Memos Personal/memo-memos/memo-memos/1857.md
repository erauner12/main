- 14:50 To-Do for Growth #daily-record ^1723924253
An interesting way to look at what's been happening lately is that you've put a lot of time into making your to-do system as well thought out and frictionless as possible. But I think the problem has been more about not doing things you believe in. We're solving the wrong problem in the wrong way. I see this issue where I don't believe in the cause.
Yes, I have a robust to-do system for myself, which may help in some contexts like work but not as much at home. That can be tuned. What's important to recognize is that I've now been given a task I care about. It's timely and a huge opportunity not only for my career but to improve my life, others' lives, and the company. It'll be a good growing and learning experience.
Now, this tool starts to become very useful to me because I actually need to use it. Before, it was just about helping me juggle as many things as possible. But that's not going to further your career or make you happier. Building towards bigger goals is the way, and I think I have the means to reset and filter down to what's necessary now.
Don't forget everything else—write it down when it comes to you. If you get overwhelmed, know that it's okay because you built a system for that reason. It has the flexibility to handle overwhelm and put a process around it. It's a good feeling to realize it hasn't been all for nothing, and now I'm really about to put it to the test. This is my system.
It's not just the system; I'm glad to be doing something I'm excited about. I'm looking forward to getting up at 5:00 AM without even trying, even though I didn't get much sleep the last day. This isn't an Adderall-driven binge of work. Since we started this effort, I haven't needed it. I genuinely want to do this and am not using it as an escape.
In fact, it makes me feel freer and happier not worrying about things out of my control but focusing on what I can control. This is one of them. I've always felt like there was no way to make things better and that it would take forever, but now I've been given an opportunity with someone who sees my potential.
Working with Varsanas is great because he's the kind of person I'd like to become. I respect him and realize there's a lot I can learn from him, even if I'm never a software engineer again after this job (which probably won't be the case). My point is, I have a lot to learn, and I'm looking forward to that.
The only way to achieve balance is through the system's purpose: keeping track of things. I've almost exclusively used it for work, which helps outside of work because if everything work-related is in there, I can focus on home tasks without letting work spill over.
I'd like to use it for home as well, though I haven't yet. It's possible and that's what I'll do. Don't get too systematic about using it at home; let it fall into place naturally.
The system will be most useful for procrastinated tasks because writing them down makes you revisit them later instead of jumping to the next shiny object right away.
In summary, don't be rigid about using your system at home. Do simple things when you see them because if you can handle hard tasks, you can do simple ones too. The complexity contained in your system enables you to do simple tasks without being overwhelmed.
If something less than trivial comes up, write it down without feeling bad about stacking tasks up because that happens with work too—and you're still here thriving. You can always work your way out of it and progress through it step by step.
