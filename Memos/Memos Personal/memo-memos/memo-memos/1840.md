- 06:48 Stress primarily comes from not acting over something you can have some control over. #daily-record ^1721994519
If I find that some particular thing is causing me to have stress, that's a warning flag for me.
What it means is that there is something that I haven't completely identified perhaps in my conscious mind that's bothering me. I find that as soon as I identify the thing and make the first phone call or send the first email message to start to address the situation, even if it does not get solved, the mere fact that we are addressing it dramatically reduces any stress that might come from it.
Stress comes in large part from ignoring things you shouldn't be ignoring. People get stress wrong all the time, it doesn't come from hard work. You could be working incredibly hard and loving it, but you could be out of work and be very stressed. If you're out of work, and you're taking a disciplined approach by taking interviews and job applications and so on to remedy that situation, you're gonna be a lot less stressed than just worrying about it and doing nothing.
