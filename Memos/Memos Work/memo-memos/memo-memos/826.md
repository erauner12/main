Can you help me start to organize the structure of my helm chart better?
…
I would like to follow the Express CRD spec as closely as I can but I want to split up the sub-directories in such a way that adding another flavor of express would be trivial.
does that makes sense?
I would also like different types of nodes within a cluster to be easier to layout, I’m looking to introduce a new node type soon called “Dynamic”, which I don’t want to create yet but I want to prepare for it by modeling this one in such a way that I can make the Dynamic with ease.
Like express itself is just an umbrella, there will be many more “flavors” of it. For now, we will just focus on this one, and continue call it “express” even though it will eventually become the first flavor “mec”.
how/where should I go from here?
…
`mec_manifest.yaml`
```yaml
{{- if $root.Values.debug }}
{{ include "express.debugPrint" (list $root "Initial nodeData" $nodeData 1) }}
{{- end }}
...
{{- if $root.Values.debug }}
{{ include "express.debugPrint" (list $root "Metadata" $metadata 1) }}
{{- end }}
...
{{- if $root.Values.debug }}
{{ include "express.debugPrint" (list $root "Spec (before instanceConfig)" $spec 1) }}
{{- end }}
...
{{- if $root.Values.debug }}
{{ include "express.debugPrint" (list $root "instanceConfig" $instanceConfig 2) }}
{{- end }}
...
{{- if $root.Values.debug }}
{{ include "express.debugPrint" (list $root "Final manifest" (toYaml $manifest | nindent 0) 1) }}
{{- end }}
```
