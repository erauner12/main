- I want to approach this by creating a clear distinction in the deployment process. I've developed a new section that seems to be working well, so I believe the previous content may be redundant. While there is some overlap, I see an opportunity to connect Kubernetes and Argo CD. I don't want to undermine Barsamis's proposed process, which involves probing Kubernetes resources directly. My goal is to probe Argo CD using its custom health checks, startup probes, and readiness probes. I aim to gather the same information to inform alerting for the L1 and L2 teams regarding the success or failure of deployments.
I plan to streamline the content by removing unnecessary elements from section one and replacing them with information focused on monitoring resources in Kubernetes. This will include insights from the SRE API and the Argo CD UI. Section one will concentrate on the processes of submitting, retrying, and terminating tasks. In contrast, the second section will focus on deployment use cases and my specific needs for monitoring the health of the express pods.
