# Memo memos/353
- 14:26 over the next few days, if we start getting too many alerts that are not useful in any way, we can increase the amount of days #daily-record ^1715887588
what I find interesting is that we could probably actually split this alert into two
one could identify which need their batch resized, and another could be specifically for DCR
but let's just have the one with a low number like 3 days so that we can see it all come in to see what we are working with
