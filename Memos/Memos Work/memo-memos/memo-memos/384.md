I was thinking over the weekend, that it might actually make the most sense to create an alert for 100% completion of ICR as well. And this alert will be what eventually triggers the propagation of caches. (edited)

you don't know even after ICR is done if the node is in ready or not and how time does it take to be in sync.
So, it will need to wait for the node to return a ready status before it can proceed. Not if the ICR is done or not.
We could use the caches once ICR is done, but you don't want to have more than one node down which is not confirmed until the node is in ready.

Ah, so I guess the alert should really just be knowing when the node is back in ready status then
