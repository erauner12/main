need to remove: `snapshotsByNode` since static rebuilds are no longer a thing:  
https://github.medallia.com/gist/erauner/f1bea061a1567911ff4fa069fb95d102  
first noticed here:
```
2024-04-23 18:32:53,786 INFO tunnel stopping kubectl tunnel to pod/comcast-fe1 in tenant-101471-prod
2024-04-23 18:32:53,786 DEBUG tunnel stopped kubectl proxy on port 33521
2024-04-23 18:32:53,788 DEBUG misc got exception missing value for field "snapshotsByNode", sleeping for retry
```
- this is the error I am seeing that is making me start this.  
confirm with Sergio that we are no longer running anymore static rebuilds.
