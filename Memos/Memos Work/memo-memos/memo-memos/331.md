so, 
@sfreue
These were the thoughts and why we started looking at ETA.
What we should also do is to incorporate into the alert a comparison with the output of the Static CR ETA along with the percentage progress, such as
curl -s http://10.53.157.2:9100/.admin?cmd=rebuildStatus\&CMD_CENTER_CSRF_TOKEN\=\&format\=JSON\&template\= | grep 'rebuildETA'
    "rebuildETA" : "9 d, 6.46 h",
The alert should not be triggered for various thresholds, but a simple and singular threshold -
Tweaking the alert to trigger if the rebuild is running for 2.5 days, and the %progress is less than 80% OR the ETA of Static CR is more than 2.5 days. - This should catch most
of the criteria of clusters and give good results to further tweak as required.

Yeah the alert is reliable I would say. needs some tweaks but yeah just need to include that ETA. Will create a jira and work on it
Link Context:
use this to make ETA available to the alert
