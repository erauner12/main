> Hi there! My 2 cents on this is that we should think carefully before starting to use feature like this; there must be a clear gain, something that we cannot achieve with our current tools that justify its use; specially if it is not GA yet. If we don’t need this now for the initial PoC maybe we can postpone it for the next phase? In particular it would be ideal to have clarity on how we plan to version/maintain the helm charts and then map it on tools/features available to implement it to decide which one we’ll select.
> We can play with the feature in YUL1, but I would try not to tie its usage to anything we plan to deliver soon.
