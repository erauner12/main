> The bounce node thing needs some requirements analysis: Conversations with 
 about how they want to use it, scenarios for multiple targets, how they think it should behave in those situations (e.g., restart in parallel, sequentially), etc.
It feels wrong to me to conflate a no-op deployment (which is what I interpret you to mean by "rolling restart") with bouncing nodesâ€”at least from the requirements analysis perspective. Those are separate use cases to me. I'd be very hesitant to merge them without discussions with the stakeholders first. I'd want to see a clear matrix of options and interactions between different approaches. It's not at all obvious to me that it has to be exclusively one or the other.
