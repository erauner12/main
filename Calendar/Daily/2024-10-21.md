The goal is to ensure that the deployment revision changes when any relevant parameter changes. Here's my recommendation:

- Include all parameters that directly affect the node's configuration or behavior.
- Include global parameters that impact the node's operation.
- Exclude derived values that are calculated based on other parameters.
- Include parameters like container memory and full service name if they are calculated outside the main parameter merging process and can change independently.

The reason for this approach is:
- Any change in direct node parameters or global parameters should trigger a new deployment revision.
- Derived values are typically a result of other parameters, so including them would be redundant.
- If container memory or full service name can change independently (e.g., due to a change in calculation logic), they should be included to ensure the deployment revision captures these changes.

1. Difference between parameters and derived values:

- Parameters are input values that define the configuration of a node. They come from various sources like global config, node-specific config, etc.
- Derived values are calculated based on these parameters and don't add new information to the node's configuration.

For the deployment revision calculation, we want to capture changes in the input parameters, not the derived results of those parameters.

1. Ensuring unique revisions for parameter changes:

To ensure that any parameter change results in a new deployment revision:

1. Include all relevant parameters in the deployment revision calculation.
2. Use a consistent method to serialize these parameters (e.g., JSON stringify in a sorted manner).
3. Hash the serialized parameters to generate the revision.

This way, any change in the parameters will result in a different hash, thus a different deployment revision.

Remember, the goal is to capture configuration changes that require a new deployment. If a derived value changes but all input parameters remain the same, it typically doesn't require a new deployment (unless the derivation logic itself has changed, which would be reflected in the code version).

Based on this, I recommend including all direct node parameters, global parameters that affect the node, and any independently calculated values (like container memory if it's calculated separately) in the deployment revision calculation. Exclude derived values that are direct results of these parameters.
