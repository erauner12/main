Something happens that pitches me into a negative state

Create some hassle for yourself that will take time to unwind

You either can be free right now, or you can’t be free.

This is as good as that, or you don’t know how to practice

Litmus test

No big surprise, just re recognize

You cannot keep score on what arises.

The litmus test, is actually.

The arising of an ugly thought is not the litmus test. The litmus test is actually noticing that. What you can then recognize

It is not about what is arising. It is about what it is arising to.

Decide for yourself  
That it is true. It is not someone else telling you what it is.

Proceed with confidence in its spontaneous unfolding.
