## SRE API Slack Integration and UI Guide

This document provides step-by-step instructions for using the SRE API Slack Integration to manage tasks like `MecDeployClusters`. It also includes information on how to track progress using the SRE API UI and Slack notifications.

## Slack Integration Overview

The Slack integration allows users to submit tasks directly through a Slack channel, enabling easy interaction with the SRE API.

- Use the `/sreapi-submit-task` command in Slack to initiate a task.
- The task can be monitored via both Slack and the SRE API UI.
- Slack messages provide links to track task progress.

You will receive confirmation when tasks are created, and links will be available to review progress directly in the UI.

## Slack Thread Workflow

Once a task is submitted, the following key interactions occur in the Slack thread:

- Task creation is confirmed with a unique identifier.
- You can track the task with the "Open UI" link, which directs you to the SRE API task management page.
- The "Get status" button provides real-time updates in Slack.

The task ID and progress can also be viewed in the UI to ensure all steps are completed.

## SRE API UI Details

The SRE API UI provides a detailed overview of the task, including the task type, status, and logs.

- Task summary shows key details like customer ID, deployment ID, and task state.
- Logs are available for each step of the task, which can be useful for troubleshooting or monitoring.
- The UI allows you to manage the task with options to retry, resubmit, or terminate it.

This UI provides a comprehensive view of the entire task lifecycle, making it easier to manage and track multiple deployments.

## Task Progress Overview

The task progress section in the SRE API UI breaks down each step involved in the task:

- Each step shows a status such as "Completed," "In Progress," or "Failed."
- Details about the step, including the exact time of completion and any relevant information, are available.
- You can view specific steps like `pr_create`, `monitor`, and `finalize`.

This section is critical for tracking the task as it moves through various stages, ensuring everything runs smoothly.

## Examples of Task Scenarios

The following examples illustrate common use cases for submitting and managing tasks through Slack:

- Submit a `MecDeployClusters` task using `/sreapi-submit-task MecDeployClusters for user @username on deployment_id DEP-7777`.
- Slack will confirm the task submission and provide a task ID.
- The UI will show task details such as the Express version being deployed, the configuration changeset, and the list of nodes involved.

These scenarios serve as a reference for setting up and managing tasks via the Slack interface.

## PR Management and Monitoring

When tasks involve creating pull requests (PRs), the Slack integration will notify users of PR creation.

- Slack will show messages like "Target Order 1: Created PR 74631."
- The automerge setting will indicate whether PRs are merged automatically or require manual review.
- PR validation and monitoring steps will also be shown, ensuring that all steps are completed before merging.

This helps streamline the PR process and provides real-time feedback.

## Monitoring Task Progress

The SRE API UI allows for detailed tracking of each cluster and node involved in the task:

- The UI lists all clusters targeted, their data centers, and their health status.
- Each cluster displays a "Healthy" or "In Progress" status, with details available for nodes.
- For ArgoCD-managed tasks, a link to the ArgoCD page is available for further insights.

By monitoring clusters and nodes, users can ensure that deployments are proceeding as expected.

## Task Details JSON Example

Below is an example of a task configuration JSON, as seen in the UI:

```json
{
	"automerge": false,
	"clearOverrides": true,
	"configChangeset": "f119dcbe4680c9fbf743e831d0629c5ed4944606",
	"deploymentId": "DEP-7777",
	"expressVersion": "express-e690.8",
	"target": {
		"targets": [
			{
				"clusters": ["varsamisktest"],
				"datacenter": "den",
				"nodes": ["fe1"],
				"order": 1
			}
		]
	}
}
```

This example illustrates the parameters and configuration details required to initiate a task. The JSON format is helpful for understanding what inputs are needed for specific tasks.

## Additional Resources

To manage tasks more effectively, consider the following additional resources:

- ArgoCD integration: Track node status and details through the ArgoCD links in the UI.
- Task retries and resubmissions: Use the UI to manage failed or incomplete tasks by resubmitting or retrying.

These tools provide extended functionality for monitoring and managing tasks throughout the deployment process.

## Inputting Information into the Main Slack Form

This section outlines the process for filling out the main Slack form when submitting tasks to the SRE API, such as `MecDeployClusters`. It breaks down each field in the form, providing guidance on what data to input and how to complete the form accurately.

### Deployment ID

- **Field**: `Deployment ID`
- **Description**: A unique identifier for the deployment task. This is often tied to a Jira ticket or internal deployment key.
- **Example Input**: `DEP-1234`
- **Notes**:
    - Make sure the deployment ID matches the correct Jira issue or tracking ID for the current task.
    - This ID will be referenced throughout the task lifecycle, so accuracy is important.

### Express Version

optional

- **Field**: `Express Version`
- **Description**: The version of the Express application that you want to deploy. If not provided, the system may default to the currently running version.
- **Example Input**: `express-e683.234`
- **Notes**:
    - If left blank, the latest stable version will likely be used.
    - This field is optional, but it’s recommended to specify a version for consistency in your deployment.

### Config Changeset

optional

- **Field**: `Config Changeset`
- **Description**: A reference to the specific configuration changeset being deployed. This can be a git commit hash or any identifier that ties back to a configuration change.
- **Example Input**: `8ccde240463f874ae7dc153f2eb7240c639766b7`
- **Notes**:
    - Optional, but if you're deploying specific configuration changes, this field should be filled.
    - Typically, this would match the changes made in the configuration repository.

### Advanced Options

#### Clear Helm Overrides

- **Field**: `Clear Helm Overrides`
- **Description**: If checked, this option clears any existing Helm overrides for nodes or node types in the deployment.
- **When to Use**:
    - Select this if you want to reset all overridden values in the Helm chart to their defaults.
    - Useful when you're starting fresh with a new configuration and don't want old overrides to affect the deployment.

#### Automerge PRs

- **Field**: `Automerge PRs`
- **Description**: If selected, pull requests (PRs) created during the deployment process will be automatically merged once validated.
- **When to Use**:
    - Check this box if you want the system to handle PR merges automatically without manual intervention.
    - Leave it unchecked if you prefer to review and merge PRs manually.

### Deployment Targets Configuration

In this section, you will define where the deployment should happen. You can specify multiple targets, including data centers, clusters, node types, and specific nodes.

#### Datacenter

Optional

- **Field**: `Datacenter`
- **Description**: The name of the datacenter where the deployment will take place.
- **Example Input**: `den`
- **Notes**:
    - This field is optional, but highly recommended for targeting specific infrastructure.
    - If no datacenter is specified, the system may attempt to deploy across all available datacenters for that cluster.

#### Deployment Group

Optional

- **Field**: `Deployment Group`
- **Description**: A case-sensitive field used to specify a group of clusters or nodes within the same deployment.
- **Example Input**: `Lightning`
- **Notes**:
    - This is useful for batch deployments across several clusters or nodes grouped by function or priority.

#### Clusters

Optional

- **Field**: `Clusters`
- **Description**: Space-separated list of cluster names where the deployment should occur.
- **Example Input**: `cluster1 cluster2`
- **Notes**:
    - This field allows for deploying to multiple clusters simultaneously.
    - Make sure the clusters listed here are available in the specified datacenter or region.

#### Node Type

Optional

- **Field**: `Node Type`
- **Description**: The type of nodes to deploy (e.g., Frontend, Backend). You can either select a node type or specify individual nodes.
- **Example Input**: `Frontend`
- **Notes**:
    - This is useful for targeting deployments specifically to front-end or back-end nodes without specifying individual node names.

#### Nodes

Optional

- **Field**: `Nodes`
- **Description**: Space-separated list of specific node names to target for the deployment.
- **Example Input**: `fe1 fe2`
- **Notes**:
    - Use this field if you want to target specific nodes rather than deploying across the entire node type.
    - If a node type is specified, leave this field empty to deploy to all nodes of that type.

#### Order

Optional

- **Field**: `Order`
- **Description**: The order in which to execute the deployment for the specified target.
- **Example Input**: `1`
- **Notes**:
    - This allows for specifying the sequence of deployments if the order is important.
    - If not specified, the system will determine the order automatically.

### Generated Deployment Targets

Once you’ve completed the above fields, the system will display the generated deployment targets for you to review.

- Review the list of targets before submitting the task.
- If necessary, you can reset the targets by clicking the **Reset targets** button.
- Once satisfied, click **Validate request** to ensure that the provided values are correct.

After validating, you can submit the task and monitor its progress via Slack and the SRE API UI.
