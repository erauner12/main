## Memos Personal

## Memos Work

## Working On
I'm trying to edit my custom JavaScript and CSS, but I'm having trouble accessing data from the memo itself. I need help making changes to ensure it works as I want. The issue is that I don't know how to access the necessary data, such as the memo ID. Additionally, from the debug button I've created, I can't access any data in the JavaScript that would allow me to replicate the functionality of the other built-in buttons in the application, like copying a link or performing similar actions.

…

Enhancing Functionality with JavaScript  
Custom JavaScript allows you to add interactive features and automation to your Memos.

In the Additional script section, locate the JavaScript editor.  
Write your JavaScript code. You can add interactivity, automate tasks, or even create dynamic content.  
Ensure your JavaScript code is well-structured and free from errors.  
For example, you can create a simple alert when the page loads:  
alert("Welcome to my custom Memos page!");

Once you've added your JavaScript, click "Save" to make the changes active.

…

Can you help me understand the code and the codebase so I can update the custom JavaScript and custom CSS? I want to access the memo data and feed the memo content.

here is an example of a single memo

{  
    "name": "memos/390",  
    "uid": "EKMAvsQ3ijCiEpj7VrwpQv",  
    "rowStatus": "ACTIVE",  
    "creator": "users/1",  
    "createTime": "2024-10-13T15:06:30Z",  
    "updateTime": "2024-10-13T15:06:30Z",  
    "displayTime": "2024-10-13T15:06:30Z",  
    "content": "testing",  
    "nodes": [  
        {  
            "type": "PARAGRAPH",  
            "paragraphNode": {  
                "children": [  
                    {  
                        "type": "TEXT",  
                        "textNode": {  
                            "content": "testing"  
                        }  
                    }  
                ]  
            }  
        }  
    ],  
    "visibility": "PRIVATE",  
    "tags": [],  
    "pinned": false,  
    "resources": [],  
    "relations": [],  
    "reactions": [],  
    "property": {  
        "tags": [],  
        "hasLink": false,  
        "hasTaskList": false,  
        "hasCode": false,  
        "hasIncompleteTasks": false  
    },  
    "snippet": "testing\n"  
}

I’m getting an error that I don’t understand. this behavior does not make sense?

“””  
No memo data available. Please use Debug Into first.  
“””

I have a question: why do we need to hit the debug button before we can click the copy content button? The debug button should be supplemental and not linked to another button. I should be able to click copy content anytime without having to debug first to retrieve the data. Can you help me fix this?

```

- Show me created date of todoist task
- Show me created date of memo, and when memo was last updated

---

```
ok and then next, let’s actually refresh the current memo page after the comment is created and then open a new tab with the child memo page. instead of navigating to the todoist task or asking about that
```
