daily_grateful_for: I'm grateful to have a family and friends to look forward to
  seeing for pretty big events in their lives, this weekend. My sister is having
  a baby shower and Aaron is having a gender reveal. These are going to be great
  opportunities to connect with these people.
daily_main_focus: I think my main focus today at work, will be to get those two
  fixes to DCR in so that they can be deployed at the beginning of next week.
  I'd also like to merge the srebot so that I can start taking steps towards
  owning that product. I want to also focus on starting the habit of getting
  laundry done. I want to set a precedent with the start of this potential
  relationship ( I have a date later).
