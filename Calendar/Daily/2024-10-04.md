    - The ongoing process by which the Express Operator ensures the actual state of the system matches the desired state defined in the Custom Resources.

8. **Custom Resources (CRs):**
    - Extended Kubernetes resources defined by the Express Operator to represent Express-specific concepts like Frontend nodes, Backend nodes, and Express clusters.

```
I just thought of something related to infrastructure, and if it is identified that this is a part of the issue. There are many different infrastructure-related issues to consider, but I want to focus specifically on one: the express operator, which is a Kubernetes operator. This controller manages various front-end and back-end resources within our cluster. These resources are part of the Kubernetes infrastructure we are leveraging since we are not using stateful sets or any standard configurations for the express pod(s) at least

While I am not saying that I only care about this particular infrastructure-related impact, I want to check whether it is occurring for the sake of this diagram. The scope of the entire document I am writing relates to the express operator, including what is managed by Argo CD, what is managed by the Helm chart, and what is managed by the express operator itself.

I aim to illustrate where the express operator fits within the troubleshooting flow. At this point, we should consider whether there is an impact at this layer, which I would classify as infrastructure since it is scoped at the Kubernetes cluster level. This means that all express nodes within the cluster, across all namespaces, are likely to feel this impact as well.

If you could account for this in the upcoming changes, that would be great.


We should check specifically if it is infrastructure related, L2 should check if the impact appears to be within the realm of the underlying components underneath the application (specifically ArgoCD, specifically the Express Operator)

If so, we should engage the CIF team (Cloud Infrastructure Fabric team) who happens to actually own both ArgoCD and the Express Operator before considering to the incident management process. If it is any other kind of infrastrucutre related change. We should still take the same path but the sake of mentioning in this diagram because they are so interconnected and related to the scope of the document we are updating "Express Application Management Roles and Responsibilities"


...

here is some additional context as well as far as the role of these 3 technologies that will hopefully help the change you make to the diagram (for context)

# Express Application Management: Roles and Responsibilities

## Current State

### Express Operator

The Express Operator is a Kubernetes-native component that manages Custom Resources (CRs) for the Express application. Its current responsibilities include:

- **Defining and managing Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** for Frontend nodes, Backend nodes, and Express clusters.
- **Reconciling the state** of Express application pods based on the defined CRs.
- **Implementing upgrade prerequisites and deployment dependencies** to ensure sequential upgrades of Express nodes.
- **Managing the lifecycle** of individual Express pods within customer namespaces.
- **Providing control at Kubernetes cluster-level scope** for managing multiple customer instances across different namespaces.

**Rationale:** The operator's cluster-level scope allows it to reconcile resources across multiple namespaces, which is essential for Express as a multi-tenant application.

**Important Note:** Changes made at the Express operator level affect every Express cluster, as well as every namespace and node within those clusters. This wide-reaching impact means that modifications in one data center (DC) could potentially affect multiple clients simultaneously across different DCs.

### Helm Chart

The Helm chart is responsible for defining and managing the higher-level configuration of Express deployments. Its current responsibilities include:

- **Defining the topology** of Express clusters, including the number and types of nodes.
- **Managing infrastructure parameters** such as CPU and memory allocation, heap size, Express version, and configuration changes.
- **Generating Kubernetes manifests** for the Express Custom Resources.
- **Defining the order of node upgrades** within an Express cluster.
- **Generating unique deployment revisions** for each node to facilitate the operator's upgrade process. (this should be done by the operator by default, while still providing an option to control from the helm chart)
- **Providing a templating mechanism** for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Defining pod-level configurations**, including init containers, startup probes, readiness probes, resource limits and requests, environment variables, and volume mounts.
- **Managing the startup probe configuration** to monitor the Express node boot sequence directly.
- **Configuring the readiness probe** to determine when a node is ready for traffic based on its application status lifecycle.
- **Controlling resources not managed by the Express operator** but used by customers, such as ingresses and network policies.

**Rationale:** The Helm chart provides a flexible and version-controlled way to manage Express deployments, allowing for easier updates and rollbacks of the entire application configuration. By centralizing pod-level configurations in the Helm chart, it provides clear visibility into the resource definitions without requiring operators to dig through Golang or Express operator code.

**Key Benefits:**

- Flexibility to make small changes to a limited number of resources without affecting the entire cluster.
- Ability to change just one node at a time if necessary.
- Closer mapping to the previous deployment method of manipulating custom resources directly.
- Control over generic resources scoped to specific namespaces for certain customers.
- Lower risk of affecting multiple clusters simultaneously during updates.
- Ability to test changes against one Express cluster at a time and update infrastructure in batches if desired.

### Argo CD

Argo CD plays a crucial role in the GitOps workflow for Express application management:

- **Applying changes** defined in the Helm chart to the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Monitoring Git repositories** for changes and automatically syncing those changes to the cluster.
- **Providing a mechanism** for manual and automated synchronization of application state. (the goal is to keep auto-sync on though if we can manage it)
- **Offering visibility** into the differences between desired and actual application state.
- **Mapping the status** of individual pods, including startup and readiness probes, into specific statuses like "synced" or "degraded."
- **Providing default health checks** for most applications and resources, usually based on probes.
- **Leveraging custom health checks** to provide information about specific clusters, including current state, node location, and whether it is progressing, degraded, synced, ready, or broken.

**Rationale:** Argo CD bridges the gap between the Helm chart definitions and the actual state in the Kubernetes cluster, enabling a GitOps approach to Express application management.

Any tool should be able to probe the status of the Express cluster and its nodes from the Express Operator (not just ArgoCD ex: SRE API Task)

### Interaction Between Components

The Helm chart generates manifests that define or update the Custom Resources managed by the Express Operator. Argo CD detects changes in the Git repository containing the Helm chart and initiates the synchronization process. It then applies the changes defined in the Helm chart to the Kubernetes cluster.

The Express Operator reconciles the state of the Express pods based on the CRs defined by the Helm chart and applied by Argo CD. The Helm chart defines the upgrade order and generates deployment revisions, which the operator uses to manage sequential upgrades.

Changes to Express configuration, versions, or infrastructure parameters are made in the Helm chart values, committed to Git, detected by Argo CD, and propagated to the operator through the generated CRs.

and here is also some key terminology, in case you feel it need(s) to be updated or just for context:
