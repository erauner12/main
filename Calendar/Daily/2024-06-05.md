Discuss/Create Alert to trigger heap adjustment in response to heap spike(s)

- Implement an alert to monitor heap usage spikes in Express clusters
- Alert should check for the following:
    - If there are full GCs
    - How big the spike is when there are full GCs
- If the spike is more than a certain percentage (e.g., 20%), trigger an alert
- Actions to take based on the alert:
    - First instance of heap spike: Restart the affected FE(s)
    - If the spike recurs, adjust the heap size
    - If the heap spikes repeat 3 times, prompt for manual review before taking further action

Open questions:

1. Over what period should we consider the "3 repeated heap spikes" threshold?
2. How big does the spike need to be to trigger the alert for a single FE (ExpressHeapSpikeRepeatedSingleFE)?
3. Should we split this into multiple alerts (e.g., one for small spikes over a longer period, one for large spikes)?
4. How many full GCs should trigger the check, and over what duration?
5. Should certain types of full GCs be filtered out (e.g., "Heap Inspection Initiated GC")?

JIRA 2: Alert to check for reclaimable heap

Description:

- Implement an alert to monitor heap usage trends and identify when heap can be reclaimed
- Alert should check the past 30 days of heap usage data and calculate:
    - Trend (percentage change per day)
    - Current heap size
    - Recommended heap size based on usage trends
- If the trend is downward, prompt to create a JIRA ticket to adjust the heap size for the specific cluster and DC

Ex:

```
Cluster: noom, DC: sea1
  - Trend: -3.35% per day
  - Current Heap: 150.00 GiB
  - Recommended Heap: 78.00 GiB
Do you want to create a JIRA ticket to adjust the heap for noom in sea1? (y/n)
```

Open questions:

1. What percentage change per day should be considered a significant downward trend? (.5?)
2. Should there be a minimum/maximum amount of heap that can be reclaimed before prompting for a JIRA ticket?
3. Is there a certain amount of heap that we should not go below (ex: 24GiB minimum?)
4. Are there any other factors to consider when determining if heap can be safely reclaimed (e.g., ongoing deployments, backfills, tagging, etc.)?
