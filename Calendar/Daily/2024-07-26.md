# Friday - July 26th 2024

- [x] Get the vars from the API from a task that already ran

Be able to update the vars on the API with what is on your local after running the step

I would like to create a method that gets the vars and another that modifies the vars with new contents (provide a specific task ID)

```
internal_get_vars
```

---

Be able to get the image that the task ran, the workflow image that a task used.

- `workflowImage`

---

- [x] Get parameters for a specific task from the API (already have)

Want to pull the parameters of a given task down so that I can put the same ones I can re-construct json to run that task again

Construct the entire parameters of the task, both the task specific parameters but also the common parameters as well.

Am I able to do that now or are there more changes needed?

Ex of what I want to re-construct using the client (I don't need to return the json itself but just everything to be able to create a json as such for a given task)

```
{
    "context": "TEST-2",
    "instance": "testinstance1",
    "datacenter": "fra1",
    "target": {
        "targetSpec": "ALL_FE"
    },
    "adjustment": {
        "adjustmentSpec": "ABSOLUTE",

            }
        ]

I want to be able to pick up exactly which step or steps are still in a failed state for a specific ask.

- Would need to know which steps for a specific task suceeded and which failed.
- Would be nice to also have the error for that particular step that failed for that task

This will be so that I can easily pinpoint what failed for a task using only it's ID

â€¦

I also want to be able to have a method to pull down the logs of a step

---

Could find a way to render all of the jinja files directly from the spec

---

Get public status of tasks?

Don't need now but would be nice?

---

Pull down the task logs

https://github.medallia.com/medallia/sre-provisioning-api/blob/master/python/provisioning-ng-tasks-api-client/provisioning_ng_tasks_api_client/api/default/internal_get_task_log_list.py

```
internal_get_task_log_list.py
```

---

```
could you help me update sre_api.py?

SreApiClient code

Get the vars from the API from a task that already ran

Be able to update the vars on the API with what is on your local after running the step

I would like to create a method that gets the vars and another that modifies the vars with new contents (provide a specific task ID)

in the provisioning-ng-tasks-api-client code it should be from:

internal_get_vars

internal_put_vars.py
```

```
client = SreApiClient(token, env=Environment.PROD)

# Get variables for a task
task_id = "your-task-id"
task_vars = client.get_task_vars(task_id)
print(f"Task variables: {task_vars}")

# Update variables for a task
new_vars = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
client.update_task_vars(task_id, new_vars)
print("Task variables updated successfully")
```
