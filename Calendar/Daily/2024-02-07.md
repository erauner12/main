# Wednesday - February 7th 2024

## What

- Showing off latest changes to DCR that platform team has been making
- Changes to the pipeline

---

The problems we had in first iteration of DCR:
- It was static
- We did not have the proper steps in pipeline to monitor progress of the rebuild and cleanup the nodes afterwards
- We are currently dependent on an FE node to trigger the process


## Why

RMT, SRE, Platform can initiate process on their own.

Remove L1/SRE from being needed to facilitate long lasting DCR process across multiple express instances in parallel.

Improve DCR Resiliency.
- if the ETA is looking to long, we can add farmers in the middle of the process instead of starting completely over.
- We can also take the hit if a single farmer needs to go down.


## DCR Demo


[DCR Dash - Evan Rauner - Pacific](https://pacific.medallia.com/display/~erauner/DCR+Dash)

https://jira.medallia.com/browse/SRECONFIG-2064



### What Has Been Done so Far

[Added/Modified system6 via automation (Starting DCR Farm History Upda… · Atlas/deployment@14eb17f](https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/deployment/commit/14eb17f42db55bd97e2e9da77130b2719bc1527a)
- Starts the history update


[Added/Modified system6 via automation (Bringing up the rest of the no… · Atlas/deployment@8206b8f](https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/deployment/commit/8206b8fa249743c12b58fda7e1abfeb947728a94)
- Brings up remaining farmer nodes


### Remaining Steps
https://jira.medallia.com/browse/SRECONFIG-2064


- Distributed Cache Rebuild will be triggered
- Workflow will wait for cache rebuild to complete for up to 14 days.
- Workflow will report any errors from the rebuild. If it fails, the error will be posted directly to Jira.


## Dynamic Synchronizer

Basically an FE node that we can spin up on a whim:
- This node does not need to be added to the configuration repo first.
- Does not require a BE bounce to be discovered in the topology.
- Will be helpful from an availability standpoint, with standard 3 node clusters.

```
./admin systemdcrtest1
```

During Rebuild
```bash
A/A Status:
	    Classic Frontends
	        systemdcrtest1-fe1                 : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e686.131 ready           5f5e38d65f5e38d6

	        systemdcrtest1-fe3                 : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e686.131 ready           5f5e38d65f5e38d6
	    DCR Dynamic Synchronizers:
	        systemdcrtest1-dcr-sync-0          : BOOTING         invisible  not sync  waiting         Inactive
	    DCR Dynamic Farmers:
	        systemdcrtest1-dcr-farmer-0               : ?               ?          ?         unreachable     org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException
	        systemdcrtest1-dcr-farmer-1               : DOWN            invisible  not sync  unreachable     org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException

```


Complete
```bash
DCR Dynamic Synchronizers:
      systemdcrtest1-dcr-sync-0          : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync      ready           5f5e38d65f5e38d6
	DCR Dynamic Farmers:
	    systemdcrtest1-dcr-farmer-0        : DOWN            invisible  not sync  hidden          Inactive
	    systemdcrtest1-dcr-farmer-1        : DOWN            invisible  not sync  hidden          Inactive
	    systemdcrtest1-dcr-farmer-2        : DOWN            invisible  not sync  hidden          Inactive
```


### Monitoring Cache Rebuild



```bash
./admin system6-fe3
```
- [Check Progress of system6 rebuild](http://localhost:9100/.admin?cmd=rebuildStatus&CMD_CENTER_CSRF_TOKEN=&format=VELOCITY&template=)

…

```bash
kubectl delete pod system6-dcr-3 -n tenant-105858-prod --context den
```
- Delete a pod mid rebuild
- Add a pods mid rebuild

## Next Steps


Integrate Dynamic Synchronizer
- https://jira.medallia.com/browse/SREPROVNG-411


Propagate caches afterwards (No L1 needed)
- [SOP - DCR Lifecycle Management - PAE - Pacific](https://pacific.medallia.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=SRE&title=SOP+-+DCR+Lifecycle+Management)
- https://jira.medallia.com/browse/SREPROVNG-493


Simplify JIRA Parameters
- Control tenant level inputs from deployment repo.
- User should only need to know whether the cache rebuild is forced or not.
- https://jira.medallia.com/browse/SREPROVNG-494



## Future Optimizations


A better Argocd deployment strategy

More flexible way to experiment with changes to k8s definition  
- Dedicated helm chart repository
