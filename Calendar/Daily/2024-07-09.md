Need to know

We need to test the prod deployer with screen sessions to see how many we can run.

# Optimize Prod Deployer for Parallel Sessions


## Summary
Implement a system to run more prod deployer sessions in parallel for heap adjustments (MedAdjustHeap) and MecDeployCluster, by optimizing resource usage and dynamically allocating sessions based on available host memory.

## Background
Currently, the prod deployer uses a fixed bucket approach for allocating resources, which is not optimal given the variable memory available on different hosts. This limits our ability to run multiple sessions concurrently, especially for memory-intensive tasks like heap adjustments.

## Objectives
1. Reduce resource usage per .cli session
2. Implement dynamic session allocation based on available host memory
3. Increase the number of parallel sessions that can run safely

## Technical Details
- Current Java options: `-Xss4m -Xmx3840m`
- Proposed Java options: `-Xss1m -Xms512m -Xmx512m`
- Command to check available memory: `free -m | awk '/Mem:/ {print $7}'`

## Tasks
1. Modify `./cli` script on all deployer hosts to accept custom heap and stack size parameters
2. Implement a check for available memory before starting a new session
3. Add a buffer to prevent resource exhaustion on the host
4. Update the deployer to use the new resource-optimized configuration for applicable tasks
5. Implement logic to dynamically allocate sessions based on available memory
6. Perform stress tests with the new configuration
7. Update documentation and operational procedures

## Testing Plan
1. Test on a single cluster with reduced resource settings:

```
HEAP_MEMORY_MB=512 STACK_SIZE=1m opts='-Dclusters=$cluster_name' ./cli
```
2. Perform parallel tests:

```
./start_screen_sessions.sh 5
```
3. Monitor performance and resource usage during tests
4. Validate functionality for heap adjustments and other critical operations

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Successfully run more parallel prod deployer sessions than currently possible
2. No degradation in performance or reliability of deployer operations
3. Automated system to check available memory and allocate sessions accordingly
4. Updated documentation for ops team on new deployment procedures

## Additional Notes
- Consider implementing a single-session approach for multiple operations if feasible
- Monitor and profile the deployer to identify any memory-intensive processes
- Be aware of existing regular sessions that might impact available resources
- Consider adding Grafana metrics for deployer hosts if not already available
