Certainly, you can frame your question about `jq` and the JSON structure like this:

---

So I'm using the `jq` command `jq '.processSnapshots[0].percentageDone' rebuild.json` to extract the `percentageDone` value. I'm accessing the first element of this array with `[0]`.

Could you confirm if the element at `.processSnapshots[0]` will always represent the most recently completed DCR, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed? I want to ensure that I am always retrieving the percentage completed of the latest DCR process.
