No man is crushed by misfortune unless he has first been deceived by prosperity. SENECA

Choosing Sobriety for Self-Improvement

I've decided to stop drinking alcohol for a month. There's nothing wrong with alcohol itself, I enjoyed some beers at a wedding recently and it was great. However, given the personal goals I'm trying to achieve right now, alcohol isn't helping. It doesn't truly assist in relaxation as its use is generally tied to social outings.

Even though everyone around me might be drinking during family gatherings or parties, it does not bring me satisfaction anymore. The times when I drink seem to create unnecessary issues for me rather than solving any problems.

So my decision to avoid alcohol is driven by my desire to focus on existing challenges without adding more complications because of drinking.

There's always a risk of seeming odd or not fitting into certain social circles due to this choice but that doesn't bother me much. My preference is staying slightly detached than blending in at the cost of potential mistakes caused by boozing which could lead more headaches for myself.

> No man is crushed by misfortune unless he has first been deceived by prosperity.  
SENECA
- This quote by Seneca highlights the idea that one can only experience true misfortune if they have been deceived by previous prosperity.
- In other words, when we become too comfortable or reliant on our positive circumstances, any deviation from that can feel like a tremendous blow.
- This quote encourages us to be mindful of staying grounded and not becoming overly attached to temporary successes or material possessions. It serves as a reminder to cultivate resilience and inner strength, as misfortune is inevitable in life.

Decoding the Mechanics of Addiction

Understanding Addiction

Addiction means you keep doing something despite the negative effects. It can relate to behaviors, thoughts, or substances like alcohol. People with addiction often struggle to admit they have a problem.

From an outside view, addictive behavior seems automatic and difficult to control. An example is getting lost in our own thoughts, even when we make great efforts to focus.

The key concept here is 'reward-based learning'. Imagine this - you find food (the trigger), eat it (behavior) and remember where you found it because eating made you feel good (reward). Your future actions are not based on the activity itself but the reward at its end.

Sometimes people use brute force methods like forcing themselves to breathe correctly. But what really matters isn't the behavior but rather the reward driving that behavior.

Apps designed for mindfulness meditation can be helpful for understanding these concepts. They illustrate neural mechanisms which underpin them all.

It’s not the behavior, it’s the reward. This is what is going to drive future behavior [*](https://app.napkin.one/t/7LCAlTkTblT6pRm3DtAd) #napkin_idea

I feel like I am ready for therapy. I have a good system for outputting my thoughts now.

Will be useful for bringing to the sessions instead of just essentially making things up when in there like I feel like I used to.
