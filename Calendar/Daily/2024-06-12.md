[[SRECONFIG-1978] DCR Farm rebuild for demodcrtest3 - Medallia](https://jira-dc-staging.medallia.com/browse/SRECONFIG-1978)

[switch DCR sts to created in single namespace by erauner · Pull Request #66298 · Atlas/deployment](https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/deployment/pull/66298)

For the purposes of this hackathon I think we can limit this to den since all the clusters are:

```
demodcrtest1
demodcrtest2
demodcrtest3
demodcrtest4
```

But we'll likely move this piece into

```
readinessProbe:
exec:
  command:
  - sh
  - -c
  - "response=$(curl --silent --connect-timeout 3 'http://localhost:9100/.admin?cmd=groovy&CMD_CENTER_CSRF_TOKEN=&code={{ $encodedGroovyCode }}'); if [ \"$response\" = \"true\" ]; then exit 0; else exit 1; fi"
initialDelaySeconds: 300
periodSeconds: 300
timeoutSeconds: 5
failureThreshold: 50
successThreshold: 1
```
