[[Setup Memos]]



I'm trying to setup a proper timeblocking schedule for my tasks.

I'm using todoist to accomplish this.

I was thinking that each recurring item should take roughly 30 minutes (habits, etc)

But focused time on a specific task that I am working on should block off around 2 hours

originally, I treated everything the same, an hour for all.

But I noticed that lead to too many recurring tasks being started at the same time. they do not take that long so I needed spread them out a bit more.

Then I realized for focused tasks, that an hour is not actually long enough to work on most things. I increased it to 2 hours so that I do not overbook myself but that I also give myself adequate time to work on the task, then take a break, then get back to it and take another break.

what do you think?
