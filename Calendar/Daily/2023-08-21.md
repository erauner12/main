# Daily Notes


Expressing Gratitude: Acknowledging My Emotions and Taking Control of Opportunities

So, I'm going to try something different: expressing my gratitude like this. It may not follow a specific structure, but that's alright. I believe that simply speaking openly and honestly about your emotions is likely the most effective way to convey them. With that in mind, I'm grateful for my capacity to acknowledge when I'm not feeling completely fulfilled.

And I think this weekend was a good example of a time when I realized that I wasn't feeling 100%, and I wasn't trying to go against the grain by attempting to perform as such. Essentially, what I focused on were things that I had immediate control over, such as catching up on the lawn and similar tasks. So, I'm grateful that I was able to recognize that and accept the fact that I wasn't feeling 100%, but I felt good enough to do something.

I'm grateful that at work, I'm starting to get opportunities to work on and towards things that I think will be very, pretty much the things that I've carved out for myself, that I have made the opportunity to take. I don't know, I'm glad I'm getting a shot at it. Well, what I mean is I'm glad that I'm being presented the opportunity because I've created it to work on the things that are most interesting to me. So I'm glad that I have something to work on and towards.
