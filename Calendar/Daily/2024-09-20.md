Super broad problem statement

Background

Particular problem addressed by our company

Tech and way of achieving

Broad impact

---

Well, I've never been interested, but I really… Yeah, anyway, go ahead. So, we need an animation, right? You're going to ask it out, right? Yeah. You'll need a blanket or something. It's going to sleep on the ground somehow. The UI will show something like this. It will be like this, and then there will be a problem or an animation that goes down here. It's going to take a bit of a sleep phase, yeah. When is the… Here. So, this is the first thing, right? What are you going to see?

Some bubble animation while the sound is going while the sound is running.

No. The class can be like this. When you start the presentation, it won't look like this, right? Then there will be a camera like this, okay? It will go down, and then there will be a nice sound, and then there will be a little animation that says, "run, sleep, start." Yeah. Okay? Then this happens, and the problem starts… Okay. And then there's going to be an AI sound, right? Like the one you showed me. Yeah. And then… So, I'll go back. Another thing is like sleep, right? Then the person will wake up. Okay. All right? Because they're open. When they wake up, are they notified in any way, like with the KitKat or the stickers or whatever it was? Or do they need to ask?

Oh, okay. Yeah. You know what I mean? The person in the situation of how the app is supposed to work. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean it makes sense. I was wondering if there was any user input required at the end of the flow. I don't think so. They just have comments there. You don't have to show that part. Yeah, I think this would invade the later app works, right? So, this is slide number one. It should take about one to two minutes. That's very important. Okay? Yeah. The whole sequence and what's going to be said here should be very thoughtful. Right? Yeah. It shouldn't be crazy or basic, like setup information. So, it's not appealing. It's like if you just say, "You're a good guy." Yeah, that's kind of what I mean. They have to read about this portion of the app sound. And you can hear me… Yeah, just send me that video. Whatever sound you gave me earlier. Yeah, I'll send you that one. Yeah. Practice. No. Read the graph there, actually. Yeah, the text has what you're going to say. What's it going to say? I don't know. He showed me something earlier. That one was, "Welcome to this app. Welcome to the big time." Ah. Listen to that. It wasn't like… You would love… You're going to finish that sound. You're going to finish that sound. Okay? At the end, you're going to finish it. Okay. So, this is slide number ten. Yes. Oh, I have a look. I have a look. So good to you all, yeah? Yes. I'm just curious what you're working on.

So relaxing. Before you can focus on instilling good habits and removing bad ones, this app doesn’t bother you. You don’t have to put in much effort. It’s seamless and safe. How do you know it works? There’s research to back it up; it’s based on the latest advancements in therapy. They conducted a study with 100 participants. Half of them preferred Kit Kats, while the other half liked M&Ms. They were surveyed before going to sleep at a specific time in their sleep cycle. After laying the ad again, they were asked about their favorite chocolate. Surprisingly, 80% of them, not just 50%, chose Kit Kats. This can lead to an addiction to something else. What do you think? When discussing addiction, it’s important to recognize that, in a sense, we are all addicts. We constantly seek out things that provide us with pleasure. When we use these things incorrectly, we find ourselves needing those quick hits of dopamine and oxytocin. Instead, we should cultivate the right habits to achieve those feelings. This gives you a goal. Now, you’ll need to present this in four minutes, right? Yes. You’ll need to keep it concise. If you take five minutes or more, we might have a problem. But you’ll be fine with them. I’m sure it will go well.

---

I think about a pocket knife, specifically a Swiss Army knife. It has a corkscrew, a screwdriver, and various other features. However, these are just features, not benefits. I don't care about the specifics; I want to know how it benefits me as a customer. What problem does it solve for me? If you're telling me that people already go through therapy and that’s your target customer, are you saving them time or money?

There are things that people value, which are irreplaceable or hard to earn. Understanding this means being able to save money, especially since it doesn't cost as much as a therapist. Now, you need to clarify what you do. Explain how you know it works. Your example is effective when it tells a long story. For instance, if you say, "I’m an ex-hematologist, and I've worked on this," or mention studies conducted by reputable institutions that have tested your methods, you must articulate this concisely.

Next, you need to build attraction. When I look at startups, I want to see momentum—customers and traction. I’m not interested in potential alone; I want to know that you’ve made sales. Those are specific elements to consider, regardless of how many slides you present. Then, they will ask you to provide proof.

---

This time of the week, I have an issue. I spoke a lot today—ten words, to be exact. I've already used this. When you talk to the app, all you want to say is, "This needs something more." I've been going to the gym once a week, but I want to go every day. I want to spend time with my partner or at the gym daily.

Okay, talk to the app and give it a plan. Suggest an addition. The ecosystem is free, right? Okay. And you approve it, saying that's good. Please, it matters to me. You're right; you never know if a team can handle it or not.

Oh, you just sleep through the whole scene. But the next day, the app pings you and asks, "Hey, by the way, did you go to the gym today?" Gotcha. So, there's a moment of reflection you have to consider.

Yeah, but then it's like a reflection. It provides complete benefits. Yes, benefits. It tracks your habits too. You can include your daily routine in it, right?

Yeah, but the actual benefit is that it's effective. It shows you the things you want to achieve over time. So, you complete the feedback the next day. Gotcha. But the app knows if you did what you intended or not.

Okay, cool. And then you provide a reason for your decision. Why not? Oh, so what's your revenue trying to do?

---

They have a name for it. That is the initial plan. There are also bioethicists, psychologists, and people in therapy involved. Originally, it’s about what influencers can do. The thing is, influencers will cost you something. They want perks and benefits. I don’t understand why you would make it a premium service with ads because that makes it very noisy.

No, I’m not going to deal with ads. I think there is no place for ads because it’s very sensitive. We’ve asked them to go into more detail. Right, right. It would be bad. Yes, it would be bad.

It’s going to be free for one or two sessions, like a new trial. You can record bio messages for yourself and play them every night, as many times as you want. However, the number of things you can play may be limited. That’s it. After that, you would need to subscribe.

So, it’s a subscription model. Yes, a subscription. Okay. Premium means there will be ads. It depends on how you structure it. But no ads. Absolutely.

Otherwise, people will wonder if you are manipulating them or selling them something in your resume. Yes, right. It will have to be possible. Right. Okay.

So, a subscription model makes sense, understanding that you need to prove the science behind it. Right. The plan is to show the research. What I would ask is where the research comes from. Who benefits? Who is the accrediting body that says this actually works? For instance, if 200 psychologists say this works, and research comes from a reputable institution, that would be important.

To me, as a tech person, my concern is how I will show users that it is working or not. Well, I think that’s a valid concern. I get that now, but yes.

---

I think this is a fire force. Are you saying that you want to add additional goals on top of the subscription? If you wanted to include more, right? Yeah, if you came across a subscription, I don't know, the subscription is a little strange. This is two little five goals for ten dollars, basically, right? And then… five goals a month or five goals, like paying for goals in bulk, whenever you want them. Then you subscribe, right? You have to get the benefit. It seems like you would need to see some proven benefits before subscribing or buying more goals, especially if I'm just entering the app and it's free. Yeah, so you can't twist it. Okay, so then I'll either decide, "Okay, I want to set this up and have five goals no matter what," because I know the ones I have are going to expire, or I can just buy the goals when I want them. Yeah. And… leave them for a… okay.

---

Five goals and whatever those. Five goals are. Fivegoals a month that you can modify or three that are fixed. That might o. sorry five that are fixed an. You get to keepthem. Yea. And then do those on. S expire orno So the creation of the pl. N is whatyo. 're paying for but you can't change the plan once it happens Okay, but what about the plan of the the five that are being you can change any ofthose all but you can Change them whatever do whatever you want with them. Yeah

---

Because they might, there's something you need to consider, right? They understand how to achieve their goals, and they're all set for the long term. This is just a free trial for two weeks. Yes, that makes sense. So, this is just a free trial for two weeks, and there’s only one goal during that trial: to ensure they give it a shot. It seems to work. I feel like the people who use it will always have the option for two weeks or to start the account. When the trial expires, they might think, "Ah, I'm using Model Three. I'm going to try it."

However, if we allow them to come back, the hook remains. Instead of expiring in two weeks, I wonder if it makes sense to have a goal. Maybe I just need to fix one thing in my life. I don’t have ten goals, but what if, at the beginning of each month, it restored? It could work for a week, and then you can do that two or three times.

Also, this is related to Amazon and Amazon Prime and client services. They offer a lot of options. Yes, but I feel like the nature of this app is similar to any habit. When you try to cancel before the two weeks are up, it asks, "Are you sure you want to go? We'll give you two more weeks." Then, they just keep extending it for three or six months. There we have it.

---

You can get those from the ones you're subscribed to, whether you want to or not. Yeah, you can't find them. Okay. Can you stop your subscription from this? Can you still use anything, or not? You can't use the goals anymore. Can you buy one goal? Yeah, I think that would upset me if I bought it and it said I could have it forever, but then I couldn't use it. Can you buy one goal or not? You have to buy five goals. Okay. I don't—don't give me that option. Yeah. I don't—the more options you give them, the less you have to invest. Do you have to do that? I used to for a little bit.

---

So, you wake up and need to practice. If you are feeling hesitant, remember that you just have to memorize everything you've learned. Yes, you have 24 hours. It’s challenging, I know. After this, you need to introduce the company. We will address the problem. I have to cover this part.

---

The problem is quite general. It's like, okay? Then it’s as if someone says, "Swing, do you want to talk about habits?" I sit here thinking, "We are suffering from these issues, and there are many approaches: therapy, psychology, psychotherapy, SSRIs, and self-help books. Yet, people still have questions." In the end, you might say, "After trying all this, we're exhausted." And you know what? We want to do something while we sleep. We just want to sleep and get through this. (laughing)

---

Okay, so here we go. Depending on what the AR sound is, yes. So, AR will indicate your state of anxiety. Thank you for working with me. This is my cue over here. Can you show me what your state is? Anxiety? We want to communicate the best to everyone.

---

For point 4, how does the user benefit from the standard hip? We plan to use this for various purposes and increase study time to the maximum. Then, we might go directly to point 7. Although we may not play that video, it conveyed a meaningful message about what was happening on stage. How can we create something similar?

---

Very 19 year old was he or Mrs. She was a bu. Iness and then probably 65. Years old, buthe wants to lose his money. That's the argument. I have another question about it. When you're being asked if you was a kick cat or whatever. The next day, is that at th. Same time eve. Y dayor . S t. at just randomly? Is thatjust like just the next day? Just sometime the next day. Yeah, sometime in the morning or whatever. I waswondering if there's like five g. als, for example. So throughout the day, so you're n. t having to use every single one of them. It's like sca. Tered throughout the day. It's just reminding you, like it's just random intervals. It should do kind of an interval thing.Eah, because I don't know. I don't know. It's good to talk to the associat. On between the AI sound and what it's supposed to do. So it'. Like in the study they played the M&M a few times for . Hem. So it's like with the VWill it ask y. u anything or is it just going to tell you this thing? It's just going to ask you. If you have a conversation, it's going to be a conversation. Only can start a conversation yourself, talking. It'll essentially just be the exact same message that was sent to you. The question about the plan. The talking is, any of our generation, it's going to be their humanity. It's going to be adapted. Okay. It's going to be a good thing to do much into that. I think it's a good question. But here, did you see the journey? Did you see the journey that was? No, I was a little bit late. Yeah. So this is God.

---

[INAUDIBLE] >> Okay. >> [INAUDIB. E] >> Okay, yeah. >. . Nd t. en that's going to be our users. >> Got you. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> How they how they benefit. And then we'll just kind of, we'll take forlike. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> Not everybody, because you're saying, you're saying, anybody wants to.

- How are they going to benefit

---

Some bubble animation while the sound is going while the sound is running.

---

So, let's clarify this. This guy has a problem, and he wants to work on it with a specific goal in mind. We can take one example to illustrate how he might benefit. For instance, he spends one hundred dollars a month on therapy and fifty dollars a month on medication, but he isn't taking the medication. Additionally, I need to explain to him the importance of exercising more. If you come here at 6, I won't challenge you.

---

Can we quickly go through this again? I think I understand what I'm supposed to do for the user, but how do you benefit from it? How would you like to explain that? Let's figure it out quickly. It sounds like you’re asking if this is a good transition.

Take one of those customer cases and ask, "How would this person respond?" If so, what example do you think would be the best? Should we discuss smoking? We could frame it as a good habit versus a bad habit.

It's a small point, but we're sending money from all the therapists. I like the negative habit example because it’s easy to close the loop by saying, "Hey, I didn't smoke today, and I reflected on that." I was prompted by it and provided input, which makes me think about the next time it happens. It feels like I'm being subconsciously programmed to avoid doing it again.

That’s significant. If no one else is in my life to help me through this, then I’m essentially doing it for myself. It’s about saving time and money.

The opportunity is there. It says, "Confidence goes out." It varies a lot. Pesto's on, and it feels a bit happier. We can’t help someone become their full potential, but they can still feel good.

---

---

Each of them have 2-3 goals

We are suffering from these issues, and there are many approaches: therapy, psychology, psychotherapy, SSRIs, and self-help books.

For instance, he spends one hundred dollars a month on therapy and fifty dollars a month on medication, but he isn't taking the medication.

What if you wanted to get more bang for your buck, tap into the power of suggestion

Get more bang for your buck

For instance, he spends one hundred dollars a month on therapy and fifty dollars a month on medication, but he isn't taking the medication.

- A few examples of how people will benefit:
    - Person 1 self help
        - Goal A
        - Goal B
    - Person 2 with CBD
        - Goal A
        - Goal B
    - Person 3 taking SSRI
        - Goal A
        - Goal B
        - Goal C

I would like to have a soft font

We need an icon, something simple like an "H" in the middle with some circles around it

Yoga meditation colors?

Need a consistent Color palette

---

It's AI. E. for a lot of supplements, and it's going to go out. Class. I'm doing this. I had an idea about this one right here. I was thinking about the narrative of therapy. It's not working for me, so I'm not going to pursue it. For me, therapy feels like I'm doing x, y, z, and I'm really trying to make progress. I want to get more out of it, but I find myself going back to therapy and repeating the same things. I want to move forward and reach the next level. How can I leverage something like this to create a sense of progress? It feels more passive than anything. That's how I wanted to frame it here, if you agree. So, to me, it's happening.

I think we should switch to 18 to 45. Okay, yeah. Then we want to say, "Let's see how we can help this guy." I understand. After that, we can sign him up and explain that he can personalize his plan, talk to the AI, and receive our assistance. So, I need to focus on my business. I believe I can identify the benefits. I haven't figured them out yet, but I'll work on it. Also, I understood your Chinese name.

---

Be very clear with your stuff even if it doesn't. work o. it doesn't matter try to get aw. Y like I . As having ahard time Trying . O understand what you guys w. re trying tojust help to tellme even though you were explaining it right s. Be ve. Y clear with that. I Also think onelike you guys have a bit of it like you have this you have the early session here, so you can practice practice practice What I wouldprobably do if I were. You guys would be to talk to my routine and My recommendation is to on. Y have . E only have four minutes the switch between each of you guys takes a lot of time. I love team But it takes a lot of time so What I would probably do is figure out like hey who knows this stuff the best like the four different positions and Let them handle it and then you can all answer questions at the end about the about the process and being Think you guys are the ones to do it It could be one person Yeah That's what I want. Yeah. Thank you.
