# Wednesday - August 28th 2024

could you create the ticket you mentioned yesterday? about the deployment revision? I understand you want it for the first phase alongside the express state in argocd , right?

I think the deployment revision should trigger a reconcile of the resource if the spec is modified outside of the upgrade prerequisites

but perhaps that would mean we just move it out of the pre-requisites, I don't know

Get a diff to show you her what you mean

```
sharedStorage
```

- Missing in documentation

---

```
dcConfig
```

```
$.Values.allDC
```

- Make this `dcConfig`

---

```
state:
    up: {{ $nodeParameters.up }}
    forceStart: {{ $nodeParameters.forceStart | default false }}
    provisioning: {{ $clusterConfig.provisioning | default false }}
```

```
# Remove this section
# nodeOrder:
#   - be
#   - fe1
#   - fe2
#   - fe3

nodes:
  be:
    type: Backend
    order: 3
    ipAddress: ""
    up: true
  fe1:
    type: Frontend
    order: 2
    ipAddress: ""

  fe2:

    order: 1

  fe3:

    order: 4
    ipAddress: ""
    up: true
  fe4:
    type: Frontend
    order: 5
    ipAddress: ""
    up: true
```

Preset update orders

```
provisioning
```

If nodes have order specified, use that

But use a preset by default

Make presets pluggable

Do not sort by alpha sort

It seems that this almost fixed it actually, let me show you. So I changed the fe2 this time:

But it seems that the `testinstance-fe2` did not actually change, which is arguably the most important thing? I need this to change the spec as well?

```
kind: Frontend
metadata:
  ...
  name: testinstance-fe2
  namespace: tenant-123456-prod
```

```
- name: EXPRESS_VERSION
        value: "express-e234.456"
      - name: EXPRESS_DEPLOYMENT_REVISION
        value: "74234e98-testinstance-fe2"
```

- Still the old values after the helm template.

…

Do you know why this is happening?

---

1. bring in the overlay values files the IPAddresses that the migrated clusters have defined in clusterconfig.
2. Fix the order algorithm to reflect fe1 - fe(n-1), be, fe(n)
3. Add validations and limit the keys that a user can define in the overlays values.yaml files (not sure if we need to do the same for the chart’s values.yaml file)

---

```
{{- $filteredNodeOrder := list }}
{{range $nodeName := $nodeOrder }}
  {{if $nodeName }}
    {{- $filteredNodeOrder = append $filteredNodeOrder $nodeName }}
  {{end }}
{{end }}
```

Magic debug:

```
printf "Debug:
```

---

```
helm --debug template master-express master_charts/express -f master_charts/values.yaml | grep "Debug:"
```
