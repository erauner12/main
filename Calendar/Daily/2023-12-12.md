I totally get that we're currently testing changes in specific instances like YUL1 and DEN. However, I was pondering the potential benefits of having a dedicated, centralized set of express clusters for this kind of testing. Imagine having a 'go-to' playground for our express operator changes â€“ kind of like a lab environment where we can tinker and test to our heart's content before unleashing the magic to the wider world. This could provide a more controlled, consistent testing environment and potentially streamline our deployment process. Plus, it could be a great way to catch any sneaky issues early on.
