This PR introduces an automated process for managing chart versions in the Express Helm chart and updates the documentation to reflect these changes.

Key changes:
1. Added a new Makefile target `update-chart-version`
2. Created a script called `scripts/update_chart_version.sh` to handle chart version management
3. Updated `README.md` with new instructions for contributing and managing chart versions


Tested tested updating existing `Chart.yaml` version `1.0.0` and then to a new version ` 1.0.1 `.

The new process allows for easier management of chart versions by:
- Automatically creating or updating version directories based on Chart.yaml
- Ensuring changes are always applied to the latest chart version
- Providing clear instructions for contributors on how to use the new system

Testing:
- Verified that the `make update-chart-version` command works as expected
- Confirmed that changes in the master chart are correctly propagated to the version directory
- Tested creation of a new version directory (`1.0.1`) and updating of an existing directory (`1.0.0`).

Next steps:
- [ ] Get feedback on changs, especially the new script and updated documentation
- [ ] Make the change to `1.0.0` with the new process in another PR
