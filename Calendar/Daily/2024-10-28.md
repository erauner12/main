This is the official documentation for Todoist REST API. Our original API, named [Sync API](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/), provides an easy way to deal with full and partial syncs, but it's not so simple for individual calls. Our REST API aims to provide developers a simple way to consume the most basic features of Todoist API.

## Request and Response Format

API endpoints accept arguments either as url-encoded values for non-POST requests or as json-encoded objects encoded in POST request body with a `Content-Type: application/json` header.

POST requests may provide an additional `X-Request-Id` HTTP header containing a unique string to ensure modifications apply only once. Requests having the same ID as a previously processed request will be discarded.

This is not required but can be useful for implementation of request retry logic. This header value should not exceed 36 bytes. We will be generating them with `uuidgen` in the shell code examples.

This API relies on standard HTTP response codes to indicate operation result. The table below is a simple reference about the most used status codes:

| Status code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | The request was processed successfully. |
| 204 | The request was processed successfully without any data to return. |
| 4xx | The request was processed with an error. The request was invalid and should not be retried unmodified. |
| 5xx | The request failed due to a server error, it's safe to retry later. |

All `200 OK` responses have the `Content-type: application/json` and contain a JSON-encoded representation of one or more objects.

# Client SDKs

Our Python and JavaScript SDKs make it simpler to work with Todoist data by reducing the complexity of calling the Todoist APIs.

# Python SDK

View code samples for the Python SDK by switching to the "Python SDK" tab at the top of the right-hand panel. The [getting started](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/?python#getting-started) section contains some simple examples of setup and usage.

You can find the [Python SDK source code](https://github.com/Doist/todoist-api-python) at its Github repository.

The [todoist-api-python](https://pypi.org/project/todoist-api-python/) package is distributed via PyPI.

**Install the Todoist Python SDK with pip:**

`pip install todoist-api-python`

Note that this differs from our previous Python SDK. The older SDK was related specifically to our Sync API and is now deprecated.

# JavaScript SDK

View code samples for the Javascript SDK by switching to the "JavaScript SDK" tab in the right hand panel. The [getting started](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/?javascript#getting-started) section contains some simple examples of setup and usage.

You can find the [JavaScript SDK source code](https://github.com/Doist/todoist-api-typescript) at its Github repository.

The [todoist-api-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@doist/todoist-api-typescript) package is distributed via npm.

**Install the Todoist Javascript SDK via npm:**

`npm install @doist/todoist-api-typescript`

Note: this SDK uses [axios-case-converter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios-case-converter) to automatically convert between the "snake\_case" identifiers required by the API and the "camelCase" identifiers used by TypeScript. Using "snake\_case" identifiers in your TypeScript code will still work, but it's not recommended, and will trigger a warning message.

# Getting Started

In this section we'll show how to perform some common tasks with the REST API using some simple examples.

We show code samples for each scenario using [cURL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL), the Python SDK, and the JavaScript SDK. Use the tabs at the top of the right-hand panel to switch to the examples for each language.

All the requests in the examples require a user token for authentication. You can find your personal token in the [integrations settings view](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations) of the Todoist web app and replace the token value in the samples.

# Get a User's Projects

> Sending the request:

```
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-X</span> GET <span>\</span>
  https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects <span>\</span>
  <span>-H</span> <span>"Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789"</span>
```

> An example projects response:

```
<span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>"id"</span>: <span>"220474322"</span>,
        <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Inbox"</span>,
        <span>"comment_count"</span>: 10,
        <span>"order"</span>: 0,
        <span>"color"</span>: <span>"grey"</span>,
        <span>"is_shared"</span>: <span>false</span>,
        <span>"is_favorite"</span>: <span>false</span>,
        <span>"is_inbox_project"</span>: <span>true</span>,
        <span>"is_team_inbox"</span>: <span>false</span>,
        <span>"view_style"</span>: <span>"list"</span>,
        <span>"url"</span>: <span>"https://todoist.com/showProject?id=220474322"</span>,
        <span>"parent_id"</span>: null,
    <span>}</span>
<span>]</span>
```

First, let's see how we can fetch a list of all the projects in a user's account.

We send a `GET` request to the `projects` endpoint at `https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects`.

With every request to the REST API we pass an [authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) of type `Bearer` with the token for the user account. In the sample the token is set to `0123456789abcdef0123456789`, you should replace this with your own token.

The API responds with `200` status, and a JSON array containing the user's projects. In this case they have just one project: `Inbox`.

# Adding a New Project

> Sending the request:

```
<span>$ </span>curl <span>"https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-X</span> POST <span>\</span>
    <span>--data</span> <span>'{"name": "Shopping List"}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"Content-Type: application/json"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"X-Request-Id: </span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789"</span>
```

> The response containing the project:

```
<span>{</span>
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>"2203306141"</span>,
    <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Shopping List"</span>,
    <span>"comment_count"</span>: 0,
    <span>"color"</span>: <span>"charcoal"</span>,
    <span>"is_shared"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"order"</span>: 1,
    <span>"is_favorite"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"is_inbox_project"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"is_team_inbox"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"view_style"</span>: <span>"list"</span>,
    <span>"url"</span>: <span>"https://todoist.com/showProject?id=2203306141"</span>,
    <span>"parent_id"</span>: null
<span>}</span>
```

Next, let's add a new project to the user's account.

We send a `POST` request to the `projects` endpoint at `https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects`.

As with the previous request, we send the same authorization header containing the user's token.

We'll be sending some JSON data in the body of this request, so we set the `Content-Type: application/json` header. We also generate and send an ID in the `X-Request-Id` header. This is optional but can be useful to prevent actions from being duplicated in the case of retrying failed requests. You can find further details about these headers in the [Request and response format](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#request-and-response-format) section.

In the body of the request we send a json-encoded object containing the property `name` with the value `Shopping List`. Setting the name is mandatory when creating a project, you can find details of the other optional values in the [Projects](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#projects) section.

The API responds with `200` status, and a JSON object containing the data for the project that was added. Let's make a note of the `id` value as we'll use that in the next step.

# Adding a New Task

> Sending the request:

```
<span>$ </span>curl <span>"https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/tasks"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-X</span> POST <span>\</span>
    <span>--data</span> <span>'{"content": "Buy Milk", "project_id": "2203306141"}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"Content-Type: application/json"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"X-Request-Id: </span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789"</span>
```

> The response containing the task:

```
<span>{</span>
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>"2995104339"</span>,
    <span>"content"</span>: <span>"Buy Milk"</span>,
    <span>"description"</span>: <span>""</span>,
    <span>"comment_count"</span>: 0,
    <span>"is_completed"</span>: <span>false</span>,
    <span>"order"</span>: 1,
    <span>"priority"</span>: 1,
    <span>"project_id"</span>: <span>"2203306141"</span>,
    <span>"labels"</span>: <span>[]</span>,
    <span>"due"</span>: null,
    <span>"section_id"</span>: null,
    <span>"parent_id"</span>: null,
    <span>"creator_id"</span>: <span>"2671355"</span>,
    <span>"created_at"</span>: <span>"2019-12-11T22:36:50.000000Z"</span>,
    <span>"assignee_id"</span>: null,
    <span>"assigner_id"</span>: null,
    <span>"url"</span>: <span>"https://todoist.com/showTask?id=2995104339"</span>
<span>}</span>
```

Next, let's add a new task to our project.

Again, we are sending a `POST` request, this time to the `tasks` endpoint at `https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/tasks`.

As with all requests we provide the `Authorization` header. We also provide the `Content-Type: application/json` header and optional `X-Request-Id` as we are making a `POST` request.

We send JSON again in the post body. In this case we set the `content` of the task to `Buy Milk`. We set the optional `project_id` to the `id` value from the previous response to add the task to our Shopping List project.

For more information on the other optional values you can pass when adding a task, see the [Tasks](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#tasks) section.

The API responds with `200` status, and a JSON object containing the data for the task. We'll keep a note of the task `id` for use later.

# Updating a Task

> Sending the request:

```
<span>$ </span>curl <span>"https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/tasks/2995104339"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-X</span> POST <span>\</span>
    <span>--data</span> <span>'{"due_string": "tomorrow"}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"Content-Type: application/json"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"X-Request-Id: </span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789"</span>
```

> The API returns an empty response with status 204. SDK clients will respond with `true` to indicate success.

Sometimes we can't get everything done! We'll need to update the task to remember to get that milk tomorrow.

We'll be sending another `POST` request to update the task. This time we add the `id` of the task to the url of the `tasks` endpoint: `https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/tasks/2995104339`.

We use the same headers for authorization and content-type. We also provide the optional request ID as we have in the previous steps.

This time we'll set the `due_string` property of the task to `tomorrow` in the JSON post body. The task will be automatically scheduled for tomorrow's date. You can find more information on due dates in our [Help Center](https://todoist.com/help/articles/due-dates-and-times).

The API will respond with status `204` to indicate that the request was successful.

# Completing a Task

> Sending the request:

```
<span>$ </span>curl <span>"https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/tasks/2995104339/close"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-X</span> POST <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"X-Request-Id: </span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789"</span>
```

> The API returns an empty response with status 204. SDK clients will respond with `true` to indicate success.

We finally finished our task! It's time to mark it complete.

We send another `POST` request to the API. This time we add the `id` of the task to the url of the tasks endpoint, followed by the `/close` path: `https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/tasks/2995104339/close`.

We'll pass the authorization header but no need to specify the content-type as there is no content to send in the body of this request. We'll provide the optional request ID as we have in the previous examples.

The API will respond with status `204` to indicate that the task has been marked as complete.

# Deleting a Project

> Sending the request:

```
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-X</span> DELETE <span>"https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects/2203306141"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"X-Request-Id: </span><span>$(</span>uuidgen<span>)</span><span>"</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>-H</span> <span>"Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789"</span>
```

> The API returns an empty response with status 204. SDK clients will respond with `true` to indicate success.

We finished all the tasks in our Shopping List project, so we can now delete it.

We'll send a `DELETE` request this time by adding the `id` for the project to the `projects` endpoint: `https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects/2203306141`.

As before, we set the authorization header with our token and provide a value for the optional request ID header.

The API responds with status `204` to indicate that the project has been successfully deleted.

# Next Steps

That's all there is to it! We've covered the basic concepts of interacting with the Todoist REST API and SDK clients.

You can find details of all the available endpoints and parameters for the various Todoist entity types in the reference documentation below.

In order to make requests for other users you'll need to obtain an auth token from them. You can find details on how to implement this in the [Authorization](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#authorization) guide.

> An authenticated request with authorization header:

```
<span>$ </span>curl <span>-X</span> GET <span>\</span>
  https://api.todoist.com/rest/v2/projects <span>\</span>
  <span>-H</span> <span>"Authorization: Bearer </span><span>$token</span><span>"</span>
```

In order to make authorized calls to the REST API, your application must provide an [authorization header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) with the appropriate `Bearer $token`. For working through the examples, you can obtain your personal API token from the [integrations settings](https://todoist.com/prefs/integrations) for your account.

To authenticate other users your application will need to obtain a token from them using the OAuth protocol. For information on how to obtain a token from our service using OAuth, please see the [authorization guide](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#authorization).

Note that we're using `$token` on all of our `curl` examples, so you can define a temporary environment variable containing your token and easily copy & paste `curl` commands into your terminal.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| project\_id _String_ | No | Filter tasks by project ID. |
| section\_id _String_ | No | Filter tasks by section ID. |
| label _String_ | No | Filter tasks by label name. |
| filter _String_ | No | Filter by any [supported filter](https://todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-filters-V98wIH). Multiple filters (using the comma `,` operator) are not supported. |

| ids _Array of integers_ | No | A list of the task IDs to retrieve, this should be a comma separated list. |

**Precedence of parameters**

When fetching a list of tasks, the API will do so in the following order: - `filter` (with or without `lang`) - `ids` - `label`/`project_id`/`section_id`

If you include a filter _and_ IDs, only the filter will be used. If you include IDs and project\_id, only IDs is used, and so on.

# Labels

> An example personal label object:

```
<span>{</span>
    <span>"id"</span>: <span>"2156154810"</span>,
    <span>"name"</span>: <span>"Food"</span>,
    <span>"color"</span>: <span>"charcoal"</span>,
    <span>"order"</span>: 1,
    <span>"is_favorite"</span>: <span>false</span>
<span>}</span>
```

There are two types of labels that can be added to Todoist tasks. We refer to these as "personal" and "shared" labels.

## Personal Labels

Labels created by the current user will show up in their personal label list. These labels can be customized and will stay in their account unless deleted.

A personal label can be converted to a shared label by the user if they no longer require them to be stored against their account, but they still appear on shared tasks.

## Shared Labels

A label created by a collaborator that doesnâ€™t share a name with an existing personal label will appear in our clients as a shared label. These labels are gray by default and will only stay in the shared labels list if there are any active tasks with this label.

A user can convert a shared label to a personal label at any time. The label will then become customizable and will remain in the account even if not assigned to any active tasks.

You can find more information on the differences between personal and shared labels in our [Help Center](https://todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-labels-dSo2eE#shared).

## Properties (only Applicable to Personal labels)

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| id _String_ | Label ID. |
| name _String_ | Label name. |
| color _String_ | The color of the label icon. Refer to the `name` column in the [Colors](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#colors) guide for more info. |
| order _Integer_ | Number used by clients to sort list of labels. |
| is\_favorite _Boolean_ | Whether the label is a favorite (a `true` or `false` value). |

# Migrating From V1

Version 2 of the REST API builds upon version 1 with a number of modifications, here we'll list the changes and provide some information on migrating to the latest version.

## General

- All datetime strings returned by the API have microsecond precision (`2021-01-01T12:00:00.123456Z`). Any endpoints that have a datetime parameter will accept the value with or without the microseconds present (`2021-01-01T12:00:00.123456Z` or `2021-01-01T12:00:00Z`).
- All ids are now strings, instead of numbers. Some of them may still contain only numbers, but it's not guaranteed it will continue to be that way. **All string ids must be treated as opaque byte sequences**.

## Projects

- The `id` attribute is now a string (was previously a number).
- The `color` attribute is now a string representing the name of the color instead of a numeric ID. See the [colors guide](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#colors) for details of the possible values.
- The `sync_id` attribute has been removed.
- The `parent` attribute has been renamed to `parent_id`. This will now always be returned and will return `null` if the project has no parent.
- The `parent_id` attribute is now a string (was previously a number).
- The `favorite` attribute has been renamed to `is_favorite`.
- The `shared` attribute has been renamed to `is_shared`.
- The `inbox_project` attribute has been renamed to `is_inbox_project`. This value will now always be returned.
- The `team_inbox` attribute has been renamed to `is_team_inbox`. This value will now always be returned.
- The `order` attribute will now always be returned. For unordered Inbox projects the value will be `0`.
- Projects have a new property `view_style`. This value determines whether the Todoist clients display the project as a list or board. This value can be set with the [create project](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#create-a-new-project) or [update project](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#update-a-project) endpoints.
- The **project update** endpoint returns the updated object instead of an empty response.

## Tasks

- The `id` attribute is now a string (was previously a number).
- The `creator` attribute has been renamed to `creator_id`.
- The `created` attribute has been renamed to `created_at`.
- The `assignee` attribute has been renamed to `assignee_id`. This will now always be returned and will return `null` if no user is assigned.
- The `assigner` property has been renamed to `assigner_id`. This will always be returned and will return `null` if the task has not been assigned.
- The `parent` attribute has been renamed to `parent_id`. This will now always be returned and will return `null` if the task has no parent.
- The `parent_id` attribute is now a string (was previously a number).
- The `section_id` attribute will now return `null` if the task has no parent section.
- The `section_id` attribute is now a string (was previously a number).
- The `completed` attribute has been renamed to `is_completed`.
- The `label_ids` attribute has been renamed to `labels` and now returns the [label](https://todoist.com/help/articles/introduction-to-labels-dSo2eE) names instead of ids. The attribute is always returned and an empty array will be returned if there are no labels.
- The `sync_id` attribute has been removed.
- The `due` attribute will now always be returned. If no due date has been set it will be `null`.
- The `recurring` attribute of due dates has been renamed to `is_recurring`.
- The **task update** endpoint returns the updated object instead of an empty response.
- The `id` attribute is now a string (was previously a number).
- The `task_id` attribute will now always be returned. If the comment belongs to a project it will be `null`.
- The `project_id` attribute will now always be returned. If the comment belongs to a task it will be `null`.
- The `task_id` and `project_id` attributes are now strings when present (were previously numbers).
- The `attachment` attribute will now always be returned. If there is no attachment for the comment it will be `null`.
- The `posted` attribute has been renamed to `posted_at`.
- The **comment update** endpoint returns the updated object instead of an empty response.

## Labels

- The `id` attribute is now a string (was previously a number).
- The `color` attribute is now a string representing the name of the color instead of a numeric ID. See the [colors guide](https://developer.todoist.com/guides/#colors) for details of the possible values.
- We introduced a new concept of "shared labels" to Todoist. These are labels that are not saved to a user's account but have been created by collaborators and appear on tasks. See the [labels](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#labels) section for details of the differences between personal and shared labels.
- New endpoints have been added to [get](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#get-all-shared-labels), [rename](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#rename-shared-labels), and [remove](https://developer.todoist.com/rest/v2/#remove-shared-labels) shared labels.
- The `favorite` attribute has been renamed to `is_favorite`.
- The **label update** endpoint returns the updated object instead of an empty response.
