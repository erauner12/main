Headphones On, World Off: Unexpected Contentment

The sensation of wearing headphones without actually listening to anything can be quite intriguing. It's similar to going for a walk without any specific purpose in mind.

Initially, you may have intended to listen to something, but unexpectedly, the absence of stimulation brings about a sense of contentment.

Meditation: Flexible, Brief Moments in Daily Life

Why should meditation be limited to only once a day? It doesn't have to feel like a task that needs checking off.

Meditation can happen at any time and for any duration, without being constrained by specific lengths of time. Thinking about the required 20 minutes might actually discourage you from meditating at all.

Instead, embrace brief moments throughout the day - even just one minute - to pause and observe your mental state before continuing with your activities. This way, meditation becomes more accessible and less daunting as part of daily life.
