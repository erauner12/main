Figure out why this `sretestexpress` is in here

`SIGTERM` vs `SIGKILL`

I hope you can help me update my DCR Helm chart to support both a new case and the existing one simultaneously. I also want to enhance the structure of the new DCR Helm chart to accommodate various types of nodes. This includes a dynamic synchronizer, which it currently supports, as well as a dynamic front end. I will provide details on how these differ.

Most importantly, I want to take the existing DCR Helm chart framework and redesign it while retaining its core functionality. The goal is to adapt it to the newer framework of the Express Helm chart. You will find all the necessary details in your project knowledge regarding how that works.

The main point is that we won't be directly copying how Express operates, but I believe DCR can benefit significantly from its underlying structure. A lot of work has been done on the Express Helm chart to make it more robust, flexible, and configurable than before. In contrast, the DCR Helm chart, while serving a different purpose, has not yet been updated in the same way.

Given that the use case is new enough, I think we can implement these updates while still delivering an output similar to what we provided previously with the DCR Helm chart.

Let's still keep a flag to enable the synchronizer (default false)

let's also have a flag for disabling the farmers (which should also be disabled by default)

but let's also introduce a new folder called dynamic_frontend, which should have it's own folder)

…

the only difference in the dynamic frontend is that it will look something like this:

The configchangeset that the tenant would provide would be  8096aaffdae2cb1bee0ba7ecf635dca326f0e541 , and static config for the dynamic FE node would need to be similar to a dynamic synchronizer except with

backend-services-enabled = false
slug-write-drains-enabled = false
slug-read-drains-enabled = true

roles = FRONTEND,DISTRIBUTED_SYNCHRONIZER

node-id and base-endpoint should be in line to what a dynamic synchronizer gets

…

ex:

helm template foo apps/dcr/helm_quick_cashing_dynamic_sync --values apps/dcr/overlays/den/demodcrtest1/values.yaml > output.yaml

…

can you help me make these changes to simplify/extend the dcr helm chart without fundamentally changing any of the behavior?

…

here is an example of the output.yaml

also remember that the dynamic frontend should be created in the tenant namespace. not outside of it
```

…

The whole cluster code hash would be `8096aaffdae2cb1bee0ba7ecf635dca326f0e541` , and static config for the dynamic FE node would need to be similar to a dynamic synchronizer except with

```
backend-services-enabled = false
slug-write-drains-enabled = false
slug-read-drains-enabled = true

roles = FRONTEND,DISTRIBUTED_SYNCHRONIZER
```

`node-id` and `base-endpoint` should be in line to what a dynamic synchronizer gets
