# Tuesday - September 3rd 2024

I would like to create a simple authentication system. I previously tried using Google authentication, but it did not work well for my needs. I'm unsure of the exact implementation, but I require a solution to secure my website that allows users to log in with their credentials. These credentials need to be stored securely, ideally within an environment file or similar, in a manner that is not easily compromised. Whatever the standard approach is for providing this type of authentication is what I aim to implement.
