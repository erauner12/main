## Journal

Q: What did I do to help others today?  
A: I helped Luis fix files provisionings

Q: What progress did I make that I am proud of?  
A: Made progress on a lot of different tasks at work today.

I think I’m also particularly excited about the recent changes that I’ve made to my Todoist to make it easier to know what I should be doing at any given time and what tasks are coming from those

Q: Did you have a meaningful conversation today?  
A: I think I actually did. I feel like I had a pretty meaningful conversation with mhalva. I finally took the time to respond to the Long feedback that he gave me.

It was actually a really great process to dissect the entirety of his Feedback, and deliver it back to him .

I don’t expect him to actually go back through this fully because tomorrow is his last day I think . But I'm glad that he'll be able to see that I did in fact respond and that I'll have the note that is his feedback. I’ll have my response to that saved as well.


Text to use as content for the action.Q: What are you currently excited about?  
A: I guess I’m excited about just being able to go to the play with Jess. I know that I shouldn’t be excited about this but I am.

It doesn’t really help to feel less but I’m going to allow myself to anyway

Q: What is one habit you’d like to change?  
A: Want to change the habit that Wood revolve around me, training Lucy, and small ways

They already do this to some extent, but I’d like to be more intentional about the ways that I trained her so that it feels more passive and not like I’m going out of my way to do it.

I also want to get in the habit of using my iPad as a daily driver of planning things and determining what incoming items that I should, and can work on

Q: What would you do today if you knew you wouldn’t fail?  
A: I would actually finally make the srebot changes that I know I need to make

Achieving more will not solve your problems. When the energy of "needing to prove something" is behind your actions, it becomes a form of coping. [*](https://app.napkin.one/t/DHPIcRA1agkzWRkqAliT) #napkin_idea

[[Feedback From mhalva|Recieve Mhalva Feedback]]
- I felt it was valuable to work through this feedback to let him know I cared.
- I also enjoyed using the extract highlight to dissect.
- Also used Timber to create a quick space
	- This made me think of a task I should create:
		- [Create a dataview query to pull in what gets created by Timber](things:///show?id=LLtCJFvVwV4ssxZis7dUKQ)

Feeling some hesitance with going on a run today, not sure why.
- I think I am still going to go ahead and do it.
- Even though I do not feel like it.
	- Actually, especially because I do not feel like it.
- Ended up going on the run and gathered a lot of info from doing so.

- [Put Living room back together](things:///show?id=5qQeXMm5C2eWsbLiJD9jyu)
- [Clean Dishes](things:///show?id=CApcLvR8RppDYdVxCuchki)
- [Mow the remainder of Lawn](things:///show?id=LnC2MLXTwgek7CetGkhJ2L)
- [Prepare for therapy tomorrow](things:///show?id=QXiqxauv6mkr22pUyYSPfv)

Was nice to be able to dump my thoughts like this directly into a place that was actionable.

- [try to start running at a 10:45 pace](things:///show?id=QveQrwLYj2JJnKEFHwkvHD)
- Was only a two miler. Trying to figure out what pace to start at to achieve a particular zone.
- It’s interesting to compare what changes to make in running vs walking with Lucy
> I think slowing the pace like you said would be good. Might also be good to incorporate other cardio where it’s easier to control heart rate, like a stint on the stationary bike after you lift.
- or stair climber

I think I'll have to start eating more now that I'm adding more intentional cardio. Specifically, I'll focus on a higher protein diet to maintain my current weight.
