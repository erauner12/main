Update Express Operator to Manage Dependency and Order of Operations for Partial Node Deployments

---

## **Definite Implementation Tasks**

### **1. Manage Dependencies and Order of Operations Automatically**

- **Requirement:** The operator must automatically manage dependencies and order of operations in Kubernetes deployments, based on the desired and actual states.
- **Action Plan:**
    - **Code Changes:** Implement logic within the operator to assess the desired state (as specified by the deployment manifest) and compare it to the actual state (the current status of the deployment in Kubernetes). Based on this comparison, the operator should handle the order of operations, ensuring that dependencies are respected.
    - **Testing:** Create automated tests to simulate various scenarios, such as:
        - All nodes are up.
        - All nodes are down.
        - Backend is down.
        - Some frontend nodes are down.
    - **Helm Chart Updates:** Ensure that the Helm chart for the deployment includes explicit conditionals that guide the order of operations. For example, if certain nodes must be deployed before others, these conditions should be clearly stated.
    - **Documentation:** Update the documentation to explain how the operator manages dependencies and what conditions must be met for the order of operations.

### **2. Respect Deployment Dependencies**

- **Requirement:** The operator should respect deployment dependencies if they are specified, otherwise default to a predefined order.
- **Action Plan:**
    - **Code Changes:** Introduce checks in the operator that detect deployment dependencies provided in the Kubernetes manifests. If dependencies are provided, the operator should enforce them; if not, it should follow a default order (e.g., backend before frontend).
    - **Testing:** Extend the testing suite to cover scenarios where:
        - Dependencies are specified.
        - No dependencies are provided.
    - **Helm Chart Updates:** Ensure the Helm chart template includes a section for specifying deployment dependencies and provides sensible defaults if none are provided.

### **3. Create Tests for Various Scenarios**

- **Requirement:** Develop a comprehensive set of tests that cover different deployment scenarios.
- **Action Plan:**
    - **Test Scenarios:**
        - **All nodes up:** Verify that the operator correctly identifies the desired state and maintains it.
        - **All nodes down:** Ensure the operator can handle the scenario where all nodes need to be brought back up.
        - **Backend down:** Test that the operator first brings up the backend before starting other services.
        - **Some frontend nodes down:** Confirm that the operator prioritizes the order correctly, respecting dependencies.
    - **Automated Testing:** Integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure they run with every code change.

## **Areas For Further Investigation**

### **1. Deployment Dependencies and Global/Per-Node Toggles**

- **Discussion:** The idea of global and per-node toggles for deployment dependencies was brought up, but it's unclear how this should be implemented.
- **Next Steps:**
    - **Research:** Explore the feasibility of implementing global and per-node toggles within the operator. This might involve reviewing existing Kubernetes features or custom resource definitions (CRDs) that could support this.
    - **Diagrams and Flowcharts:** Create visual aids to map out how deployment dependencies could be handled with global and per-node toggles. This will help clarify the logic and identify potential issues.

## **Conclusion**

The operator should be updated to manage deployment dependencies and the order of operations more intelligently, with robust testing to handle various scenarios. While some aspects, like the toggles, need further exploration, the core functionality should be implemented as specified. Each task should be documented and tested to ensure reliability in production environments.

I have provided some knowledge for you to reference for what I am about to ask.

specifically in the reconciliation process flowchrt and interpretation.

we will be focusing specifically on code changes to the express operator in this thread

the goal (if not already implmented all the way) is that I would like make changes to the express operator code to adhere to this new and improved reconciliation process.

basically, we need to make the express operator a little bit smarter about it's understanding of the cluster. specifically what order it is able to process deployment/recovery different scenarios (which you'll also find examples of in your project knowledge)

…

so basically:

The express deployment process should ensure that each node is aware of the state of other nodes, respecting the order and checking health status before proceeding.

The express deployment should respect a typical order if dependencies are not defined (in the helm chart)

- I have provided the full chart in your knowledge so that you can understand how I am interfacing with the express operator
    

- so the point is for example to move what is currently defined in the helm chart like:
    
    - apps/express/helm_0.0.4/values.yaml
        

ex:

allNodeConfig:

be:

kind: Backend

serviceName: be.express

upgradeDependency: fe2

fe1:

kind: Frontend

serviceName: fe1.fe.express

provisioningDependency: be

fe2:

kind: Frontend

serviceName: fe2.fe.express

provisioningDependency: fe1

upgradeDependency: fe1

fe3:

kind: Frontend

serviceName: fe3.fe.express

provisioningDependency: fe2

upgradeDependency: be

fe4:

kind: Frontend

serviceName: fe4.fe.express

provisioningDependency: fe3

upgradeDependency: fe3

fe5:

kind: Frontend

serviceName: fe5.fe.express

provisioningDependency: fe4

upgradeDependency: fe4

fe6:

kind: Frontend

serviceName: fe6.fe.express

provisioningDependency: fe5

upgradeDependency: fe5

fe7:

kind: Frontend

serviceName: fe7.fe.express

provisioningDependency: fe6

upgradeDependency: fe6

As you'll see in my documention, this is still going to be the order we adhere to but this should no longer be defined inside of the global values.yaml on the helm side of things, this should be defined in the express operator code as a part of this new reconciliation update we are adding and eventually the tenant specific values.yaml should be able to overrride on a node by node basis from the helm chart (will work on this later)

but this is kind of the overall goal, but we need these changes to the operator to makes this possible

example like this piece of a tenant's values.yaml that could override the express version beyond what is being provided as the default.

```
nodes:
  be:
    up: true
  fe1:
    up: true
    expressVersion: express-e689.154
  fe2:
    up: true
  fe3:
    up: true
  fe4:
    up: true
disableDependencies: false
expressVersion:
  Backend: express-e689.151
  Frontend: express-e689.151
```

We want to ensure that:

- The reconciliation follows the default order defined in `allNodeConfig (but inside of the express operator code)`, but only for nodes that are not intentionally down (up: false in the tenant values.yaml).
    
- The first node in the reduced list (excluding intentionally down nodes) is always reconciled first.
    
- Dependencies are respected, maintaining system stability during upgrades.
    
- Nodes are only reconciled when their dependencies (that are not intentionally down) are healthy and up-to-date.
    
- The process is cyclical, continually checking and updating nodes as needed.
    

When applying this to specific scenarios, consider:

- How intentionally down nodes (up: false in values.yaml) affect the list and order of reconciliation.
    
- Node-specific configurations or version overrides.
    
- The health status of each node and its impact on dependent nodes.
    
- How the process handles failures or unhealthy states.
    
- The potential for the reconciliation order to change if nodes are marked as intentionally down or brought back up.
    

The state of the node (healthy or unhealthy) does not matter; it needs to be reconciled regardless.

The assumption is that someone is trying to fix the node if it is unhealthy. but this will also be use to reconcile clusters that are perfectly healthy and just need updates.

There is obviously more than just the express version to reconcile but for the sake of simplicity, in the examples I only reference expressVersion but everything else is also applicable in the same way if that makes sense.

The algorithm should ensure that nodes are reconciled in the correct order based on the default order.

…

does all of this make sense?
