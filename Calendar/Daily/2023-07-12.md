It is not about finding a partner who is fully healed; it is about finding someone who is not afraid of their emotions. A person who does not suppress what they feel and can gently be present to their inner ups and downs will have a foundation of emotional maturity. - Yung Pueblo [*](https://app.napkin.one/t/Lal99HnoSWwy30fwvQY7) #napkin_idea

The Apple Watch only gives you VO2 Max estimate values for outdoor running, walking and hiking workouts, it won't gives you VO2 Max estimates for any other workout types other than those.

If you want to improve your cardiorespiratory fitness ==try doing more long running or walking workouts at a relatively high and steady pace at 65%-75%== of your theoretical max heart rate zone.

==As your cardiorespiratory fitness improves you will be able to maintain or increase your pace while your heart rate goes down.== The key thing for the VO2 Max estimates to go up is that your heart rate goes down.

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/12oeclt/my_v02_max_is_incredibly_low/jginos3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_content=1&utm_term=22&context=3)

For example, if your age is 30, you could estimate your MHR as 220 - 30 = 190 beats per minute (bpm). To find the target heart rate zone of 65-75%, you would calculate:

65% of 190 bpm = 0.65 * 190 = 123.5 bpm  
75% of 190 bpm = 0.75 * 190 = 142.5 bpm
- ==Between 120-140==

Therefore, the target heart rate zone for 65-75% would be approximately 123.5 bpm to 142.5 bpm. During your ==long running or walking workouts, you should aim to maintain your heart rate within this range to achieve the desired cardiovascular benefits==.



 
Meditation: The Art of Beginning Again

If you're someone who finds joy in starting afresh, all you need is a reason to do so. Meditation provides that deliberate excuse to consistently start anew within a given time frame. When your thoughts begin to wander, simply halt and restart. This practice isn't confined solely to meditation; it transcends into other aspects of life where restarting may be beneficial, if not inevitable.

You don't necessarily have to restart every time, but more often than not, it proves helpful. Thus, through this seemingly simple practice of meditation, one learns the art of beginning again - an ability that can turn out quite handy in various scenarios throughout life.

I'm down, but I did read that it is typically accurate? Within 1% error.  
I also looked at average 30 year old male and it seems that 190 is normal  
Problem is that I felt like I was walking pretty damn fast but could not maintain 140+ until about 20 minutes  
U  
Kind of kills 2 birds with one stone to get my walks out of the way with Lucy.  
Perhaps I will try a slow jog with her

Sounds like I could also try increasing the intensity of my strength training  
I think I'm going to try to do some of those HIIT runs outside strength company like we did

The reason I feel a nutritional track er would be helpful is because I need to start eating more with the ic reading exercises I will be doing to train for this competition

---

Working out is exercising taking the next action regardless of whether or not you want to

---

If you don’t workout In The morning, then consider going for a run before it gets hot

Obviously don't take your pre-workout before the run.

A way you are making your todo system easy to execute like Hevy makes exercising easier

- [ ] [Let therapist know of what frequency you want and why](things:///show?id=9PMh7HhMD6cALG6kpqkL3C)  
For therapy, what sort of frequency of best using session

Ex: once a week vs once a month

I think to begin with it would be nice to get together once a week. Maybe for these next five sessions. Maybe even once every other week.

My goal is to get momentum to start with and once I have them momentum, I think it’ll be easier to spread the frequency out.

Not finding anything is the point of the search

The self wants to feel better. To change in ways that are pleasurable and beneficial.

Meditation is given as a means to accomplish this.

look for the self, no self is found. What is found is the reality of consciousness. Freedom.

What is found is consciousness

In looking for the self. the utter absence of the problem that we thought we needed to solve.

Finding that absence again and again, is meditation.
