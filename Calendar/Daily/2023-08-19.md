# Daily Notes

![[Pasted image 20230819092440.png]]
- proud of myself for only having 1 beer during the comedy show last night.
- Even though I tried to get another one, I just realized that even though it never came that I still enjoyed the show. And that I didnâ€™t actually need it.
- I think I also felt good about the fact that when I was asked where we were going next after the show when it was clearly later that I should be considering going out. That I was able to easily say no without feeling bad about myself or doing so.
