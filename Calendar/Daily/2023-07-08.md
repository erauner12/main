## Journal

Q: What is one habit you’d like to change?  
A: The habit of talking more than listening. Ask more questions

Q: Who do I need to thank for help today?  
A: I need to thank Davis for talking to me about the stuff that we did

Q: Whose behavior or discourse did make me feel good today?  
A: Kathleen, Kyle’s mom. It was interesting to see her thoughts and passions


Q: Write a daily affirmation  
A: I can finish the things that I start.

Q: What do you most appreciate about your life right now?  
A: I appreciate the fact that I have like a workout partner, who, legitimately like wants to work on himself as well

Q: What is one habit you’d like to change?  
A: I’d really like to stop not entirely. But I want to masturbate just once a week because I think that it will help decrease the impulsivity that comes with the way that I do it currently.

I also think that I’ll be able to leverage this and a way that can motivate me more. If I were to meet someone, and something were to happen. Then I think I’d be more likely to enjoy that experience.

So I think generally I just need to pick up the pace on my walks, and be intentional about that

In order to more consistently move up my v02 max

User: What is the best way to steadily increase my v02 max Assistant: There are several effective ways to steadily increase your VO2 max (maximal oxygen consumption). Here are some recommendations:

1. Consistent cardio training: Engage in regular aerobic exercises like running, cycling, swimming, or rowing. Aim for at least three to five sessions per week, with a duration of 30 minutes to an hour. Gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time.
2. Interval training: Incorporate high-intensity interval training (HIIT) into your workouts. Alternate between shorter bursts of intense effort and periods of active recovery. For example, perform 1-2 minutes of high-intensity exercise (such as sprinting) followed by 1-2 minutes of moderate intensity exercise (such as jogging). Repeat this cycle several times during your workout.
3. Tempo training: Include tempo runs or rides in your routine. These involve maintaining a challenging but sustainable pace for a continuous period, typically around 20 minutes. This helps improve your anaerobic threshold and trains your body to sustain a higher level of effort for longer durations.
4. Cross-training: Incorporate a variety of aerobic activities into your routine to work different muscle groups and maintain interest. This can include activities like swimming, cycling, using an elliptical trainer, or attending aerobic classes.
5. Strength training: Include regular strength training exercises to improve your overall fitness. Strong muscles can support endurance activities and improve your efficiency as an athlete.
6. Progressive overload: Gradually increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of your workouts to challenge your body and stimulate adaptation. Mix up your training routine to prevent plateaus and keep your body guessing.
7. Proper rest and recovery: Allow for adequate rest intervals between intense workouts to avoid overtraining and reduce the risk of injury. Allow yourself at least one or two rest days per week to allow your body to recover and adapt.

Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a certified fitness trainer before making any significant changes to your exercise routine, particularly if you have any pre-existing medical conditions or injuries. User: What zone of cardio is best for this? Assistant: To improve VO2 max, it is beneficial to train in different heart rate zones. Here are a few key zones to target:

1. Zone 2: This is considered the aerobic base training zone. It typically falls between 60-70% of your maximum heart rate. Training in this zone helps build a solid foundation of cardiovascular fitness and improves endurance. It promotes fat burning, enhances the body's ability to utilize oxygen, and strengthens the cardiovascular system.
2. Zone 4: This is the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) zone, often referred to as the anaerobic zone. It typically falls between 85-90% of your maximum heart rate. Training in this zone improves your anaerobic capacity, increases maximal oxygen uptake, and promotes faster oxygen delivery to working muscles. HIIT workouts involve short bursts of intense effort followed by periods of recovery.
3. Zone 5: This is the maximum effort or VO2 max training zone. It typically starts around 90% of your maximum heart rate. Training in this zone improves your body's ability to utilize oxygen and increases your VO2 max. Workouts in this zone should be shorter and intense, such as interval training or hill sprints.

It's important to note that individual heart rate zones can vary, and it's recommended to determine your own zones based on a proper fitness assessment or through the use of heart rate monitoring devices.

Incorporating a combination of training in different heart rate zones is beneficial for improving VO2 max as it challenges the body to adapt and improve its aerobic and anaerobic capacities. It's also a good idea to vary your workouts between these zones to prevent monotony and promote overall fitness.
