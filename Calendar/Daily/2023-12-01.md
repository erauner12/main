# Daily Notes

I'm not just saying, I'm not just like saying this stuff because like I'm bored, I'm saying it because it's a problem, you know, and I'm shouting it from the rooftop here. And then in the meanwhile, like, you know, we have like, people on the India team who are like, hey, like SRE router, let's fucking go, let's do it now. And I'm like, okay, hold on, hold on. We got it. I mean, we're working on it. And I'm glad that you're enthusiastic. I don't want you to like, I essentially don't want this, them to completely take the, like project from me by just continue. But I'm also not trying to, like hoard it for myself. I think I'm having problems. I'm having trouble letting go because I know that like, given like the amount of exposure I've had in different areas of this like org, I have, I have a lot of knowledge. And, and I'm just trying to figure out where to spend that, that knowledge, like where it's best spent. And it's just, it's frustrating, because a lot of these things that we're trying to build, like SRE router, like which I'm excited about, I think it'll be like, you know, to whatever level of involvement that I end up having, which I, I'd like to drive it. I think will be beneficial, but really, in my opinion, the reason that we even have to build something like this is because of all the problems that are resulting in the way that we deploy Mac. Like, I'm just even noticing it with the way we're doing DCR, which is like, I have these like readiness probes and startup probes and like liveness probes, like they basically do what what we're trying to build a custom solution for, which is when the pod goes down, as a result of some condition, then it brings the, you know, it, it brings the pod back up, which is like, that's just an example. I just, I'm just, I'm, I'm, we could say, we could say that the SRE router should be considered as part of the improvement of the MC deployment, right, at some point. I think that is a prerequisite, but at least it's something that we should take care of at the same time that we are going to remove all the MC deployment, right? Yeah, I think I think it is. It's a part of it, for sure. Because we can't just jump directly into like, the end goal solution, like, unfortunately. But I guess what I'm trying to like what front I'm trying to make sure that we're aware of. When I say we, I don't mean just our team. I mean, like, particularly the people who are in that in that meeting that we had a few weeks ago, like Larry and Maddie, and all these people, I want them to be aware of what we have, like, with DCR. Like, we're able to like, this past couple weeks I've been working on, we're able to spin up nodes, like in a more Kubernetes way, like, when it whenever the node comes up, it is completely being like, it's not just a farmer node, it's like essentially an FE node, we're able to spin that thing up. And it's, it's not it's, we're making like, efforts towards removing the the constraint that has always been like a static topology. Like this topology is now becoming like dynamic. And I think the reason that we have all of these deployment, like, like proprietary put deployment problems is because we're, we've been constrained by the like, one of the reasons is that we've been constrained by the fact that Express has, has to be deployed like this. And I think we're, you know, we're, we're starting like, I just, I just want to make sure that that that knowledge is, is taken into consideration with whatever decision we decide to make next, because it really is like, it's going, it's going to change the way it's going to change the way that we I hope I would hope that it's going to change the way that we deploy Mac. So we don't have all these moving parts. We don't have all these unnecessary, like, oh, we got, you know, a proprietary operator, we got a proprietary deployer, we got a proprietary this and that, like, the goal of platform team is to be able to have, you know, to be able to make the changes necessary to express so that they can deploy their application on Argo CD. That's the goal. And they're the customer, like, we should, we should take that into consideration, really. And, and just all in all of these thoughts that I'm having, like, I'm just, I'm trying to make like the tiny little changes that are, are necessary to start moving us in that direction. And it just seems like, and it seems like nobody wants to think about it. Nobody wants to think about the right way to do it. Everybody wants to figure out how to do the convoluted way that we've always done in just a different package. Yeah. And, and that's frustrating. That's frustrating to me, but I'm sorry, sorry to just Not only for you. You have to know that. It's not only for you. I think that we have, we are like a couple of guys more that are really worried about this and how they are thinking. They, when I say they, I mostly say CF, right? Because they are the one that are thinking of how we should do this. Okay. And they want to have the They want to, they want to have the, the whole thing. It really just shouldn't be the case. It's not, it doesn't make any sense at all. Like, No, it brings more troubles than solutions. So yeah, yeah. I completely understand what you are saying. Okay. And also I think that you have like too much. Okay. And I would like to get an order. Right. Like, okay. You have VCR that maybe, you know, more than me about that, but maybe that should be a way that we should handle and express cluster, right? Eventually. Eventually. Yeah. Like, like we are handling VCR from that should be like the final solution for handling the express cluster. I don't know how much effort that is going to take. I don't know who will take care of that and which is the timeline to have that in production. Right. So that is one thing that is a thing that I believe we can not handle. Right. At the moment that is going to depend on platform. Right. No, with VCR. No, like the reason I've been spending a lot of time on it this past couple of weeks is because a big, like Sergio has been going out of his way to, he's been listening to the feedback I've been giving him like, and immediately making changes in the image and we've been testing it. And he's, yeah, he's, he's been hearing the feedback and he's because like his frustration lies in the fact that VCR is not, you know, everybody was like, oh, it's going to be this. And it wasn't. And because of X, Y, Z. And so I gave him X, Y, Z. This is why, this is why it's not the way that you want that, that you, that everyone's expectations work. And now we have, we have what we need to actually make this much, much smoother. And so I've been working on those chain, refactoring, basically the whole process. Now that we have all of the, like the, we have all the tools available. I think, I think we're going to like, basically what they've said. The platform is that we're not going to do another DCR until it is, until, unless we're using this balanced, DCR balanced feature, because this, the static DCR that we've been using up until this point, it's useful, but it's not, it's not the, we realistically, the, the, the value that DCR is going to give us. The value that DCR is going to be able to provide is when we're going to be able to, able to say, okay, every single like DCR that we do is going to have X amount of nodes. It's going to come up no matter what, with this amount of nodes, unless we specify otherwise. And then when we realize that that's not enough, we can just move, slide that on up, like, will it, like, like at, in the middle of the build, like it's say it's going to take like three days and we'll be like, oh, I want it to take longer. I'm going to give it 10 nodes and it's able to like recognize that and then balance that workload, like dynamically. That's what we have the ability to do now. The new feature of balance, the balance feature is to raise the amount of nodes that you have to process things even faster, right? Yeah, because before what we basically needed was, we needed to know exactly how many nodes were required at the beginning. And that's how many nodes would do the job. So in addition to that, we have now this new node that is like slight, it's, it's, it's slightly different than an FE node, but it basically is an FE node. So before the, it was a pain in the ass that at the big, at the end of the workflow, we had to spin up a prod deployer session, bring the FE node down, bring it back up. It's like, oh my God, this is terrible. But now we have our own sync node that we can spin up. It does the history update, and then we able to just turn on the farmers right after that. So, like, I think it's going to make the process a lot smoother. And I'm excited about those changes. And you can spin up and you can reduce the amount of nodes that you have as well? Yeah, you'll be able to basically like, we won't need, I'm going to try to like remove, because I'm going to try to remove the, a lot of the complexity that was required. Because basically before you were able, what you needed to know, like, say, say you don't know anything about DCR, you would have to know from the JIRA, which FE node to choose, which by default will be FE1. But just the fact that we have this dependency that you have to know anything about it at all, that's the problem. So we're trying to remove that problem by removing the, like, putting all the complexity behind it inside of the deployment repo itself, so that the only job of the JIRA is approve, or JIRA or API request, whatever. Like, nothing should need to be known by the person who's doing it, other than they want to start a DCR, that's it. And now that we have removed this, we removed the need to use an FE node, that's one, like, huge thing. And the second thing is that we don't need to know how many farmers are necessary, or how much memory we want to allocate to it, or any of that. We just, we set, we can now set a default for all of those things. And then whenever we realize that, hey, it's not, you know, running as, like, the way that we want it, we could just go to the deployment repo and take the number that's 10 and turn it into 20, or 20 to 40, or 100. And we'll be able to kind of toggle, like, adjust those things without having to spin up another JIRA. The JIRA is only the starting of the process, and then we can actually just control the rest of the process with the deployment repo itself. That's how it should have always been, and it couldn't be until as of recently. And it's just, it's given me a lot of insight as to what I think can be possible in the future if we deploy MEC with Argo CD. And no, I don't expect everyone to be like, all right, let's do it now. No. I just want everybody to be aware of, like, this is possible, and that, like, what we should consider and whatever approach that we take is that this should be the end goal. Because that's, this is what platform wants. It's platform, it's essentially their application. So, sorry, I know I'm all over the place right now. I'm kind of just venting. I like this. I like this. Because I can understand better.

---


I don't know, maybe you know, but this could affect the Kubernetes infrastructure. I mean, can we have some issues creating so many nodes for a cluster in terms of resources? Yeah, we could. But I think the point is that it's possible now. And so, yeah. Because how are you in App-New-Nodes? You are not using the Prodeployer, right? No, no, I've removed it. When we got the SyncNode, we removed the Prodeployer completely. We have the Dynamic SyncNode. Basically, I'm just taking a staples set that has all the same properties as what the Express Operator would be giving it, all the same Kubernetes properties. And I'm just spinning up a pod myself with it. And we got the Express Operator as well? No, the Express Operator, I'm not using it, thankfully, because, well, again, I think the Express Operator is and can be useful, and we should probably actually use it. But yeah, it's one of those things where I'm not going to, I don't want to digress too far. In DCR, we're able to take a staples set and set the replica count to whatever amount that we want. So if you look at Express Admin and, you know, let's say a giant cluster is doing a cache rebuild, it will be trivial, like it will be no problem at all for you to look at that Express Admin and for there to be like 90 nodes running. And it's a matter of one commit, one commit to bring them up and another commit to bring them down. And I'm not, all I'm saying is, I think that. I think that this is eventually how we probably want to treat like deploying Express, like in the same way, because I think this kind of is the standard in which this should be done. Like going off and like creating like our own like proprietary thing, nobody wants that. When I say nobody, I mean the customer being the platform team. They don't want that. They want something that is open source, like Argo CD is, they want something that they can control on their own that they don't have to go ask Mirtaza or anybody to go do anything with. They want to be able to do it on their own. And that's why I think we really need it, like in whatever next discussion we have, I think we need to like concretely define what the end goal is. And I think that it might not be exactly this, but it should be close. That's actually like I made, I shared that, I shared that document that I gave with you. I shared it with Maddy because I said like, hey, like this, you know, I've been thinking about what was said in the last meeting. And I know we had that meeting a few months ago, probably more than a month or two ago now. And I really, I feel like we haven't followed up on that. And I guess I don't know why that is, but I wanted you to be aware of like how I feel about this. And this is what it is. And so he was like, OK, that's interesting. Like, I want you to like help me understand how DCR works so that like you can. So I'm going to get together with him next week and just get like I'm going to do it right after the meeting that I'm going to show Varsamis, I'm going to show Maddy right after. Just like a one on one, like this is what's possible now. And I'm hoping that like starting to like propagate this knowledge, it will hopefully have an effect that is OK. We now have like some new information as to how we can deploy Express next, like how we can start looking at this. We don't have there's a constraint that has been removed, maybe not like right now, but it's it's being demonstrated through DCR that it's possible now. And I'm going to show exactly how and why so that a greater audience can become aware. Yeah, yeah. And you are going to have that meeting only with Maddy? Yeah, I think it was just going to be me and Maddy just because I think and what he mentioned, too, which I agree with, is that we shouldn't make a big push on this until. Until the resources are ready and available and that like the and that everyone is in alignment as to what needs to happen, you know, despite what this team thinks should how it should be done, that team should think how it should be done, you know. There's been a decree of this is how we're going to do it, because this is like what we this is what we've decided after like going back and forth on it. You know, like I think a lot a lot of factors need to be like. Like so that's that's why I'm just going to keep it local, just me and Maddy, I want because I think he has a lot of influence over over people, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, I just I know from based on past attempts that making these small, you know, attempts to like move in the right direction. It there's a lot more friction than there should be and and and in my in my attempts to do so, and it's it's it's for reasons that are out of my control and I don't understand why. So I think, yeah, what I have control over is DCR and and SRE router and, you know, anything that goes through the SRE API. So I'm just going to continue trying to balance like whatever is most like whatever is of highest priority of those three things moving forward. And I'm hoping that I'm able to do that. Well, yeah. OK, let me tell you that, OK, because I feel like you have like these three big projects that are around you and maybe that is I'm not going to say too much, but maybe that is overwhelming to you. Right. So any C deployments, I know that we have plenty of brokers there that we need to start planning that first, document all the things that we have, start asking why they are not using the tool that we already have for deployments and then we can discuss how we can improve that. OK, yeah. But for SRE router, I believe that that is your child and we need to be persistent in trying to keep that in the team. Right. Yeah. I'm not comfortable giving that to the Indian team, that actually I don't even remember the name of the team right now. Yeah. So because they have a name, but I cannot remember. I keep feeling like an asshole when I say India team because I don't know what the name of the team is either. But I am glad that they are like ambitious about getting involved. There's no doubt about that. I just what I guess, you know, to be completely honest with you, I'm trying to figure out how to shine and I see a lot of paths to shining and I'm trying I'm having a trouble like deciding for my own self which path to take to get me to the next level. Because, you know, I'm in these conversations with people who have like three different, you know, titles above me and I'm still I don't know. I'm just. I want to I want to progress and I want to be able to put my like effort towards something that's meaningful enough that, you know, that not only I will I feel like personally like fulfilled by like pursuing, but I also want I guess I want others to be like, yeah, that that's a that's. I don't know, I guess. I want to I want to move up, you know, that that's that's what yeah, that's what I want to do. Yeah, that's great. That's great. I am very comfortable saying that you have the tools to do it. OK, you can roll up really quick, you're really smart and you have like this sense of beauty that is really, really good. And I have to say, OK, I'm not saying this just to make you feel comfortable. I know that you have the tools, but yeah, I would like to help you try to put an order to all these things. OK, I would very much like to see your farms as a router. I know that you are still you are already working on that for Sammy, so I'm happy about that. I will feel comfortable. Giving that to the Indian team, right, because I feel like it was your idea. You have the power and knowledge to do that. So I'm not going to take you that away, OK? I don't want to say that maybe you could start doing other things and let the Indian team take that. I already spoke with him about that. He was just worried about all the time that you could spend on that. Yeah. But yeah, yeah, that is the only concern. And but at the same time, I want you to feel comfortable doing things that you feel like have a real impact in the company, right? Yeah, yeah. And if it is a router, it is part of that. So I would say that let's keep working on this farm as a router. And just let me work with the team and let them see the performance. OK, but still keep having these conversations with the rest of the members about this farm. We are spinning up nodes because that is the future for sure. But let me let me take care of the business for you, OK? OK, so I just need to concentrate your energy on the router and the farm. Yeah, I think those are the two things that are going to help me shine the way that I would like to. So, yeah. Yeah, yeah. And remember this, at some point, I know that you were trying to have a video for this farm, but at some point you will need to do like a video. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I and I truly I think after making some of the changes that we're about to make, I'm going to feel much more comfortable presenting this because it actually will be useful. It will be doing something that is taking a huge burden off of our shoulders, whereas before. I did as much as I could, but working with what I was provided, it wasn't enough. It was like I think now. I think now, given what is possible now, we'll be able to spin up a DCR farm, do the do the rebuild, break down the nodes in one task. We'll be able to see from the SRA API UI every single DCR that's running right now and which ones have failed within the past X amount of days. We'll be able to like, you know, hopefully like see what rebuild percentage is happening. But more importantly, I'm not as like I'm not I'm not as concerned about what the rebuild percentage is. All I want to know is, is it running right now or has it failed yet? And I think using the API UI, the changes that Camille is making right now, that's going to be possible without needing, you know, the SRE bot using a cron job to let everybody know whenever like movement has happened. We don't we're not going to need that. We'll have our own job mechanism for that. So that's I'll feel a lot I mean, I know that like I'm setting the bar high, but I'll feel a lot more enthusiastic about proposing like I like showing, demonstrating what what is DCR once we have these things in place. And so I'm working on them right now. OK, good. And you're going to have a meeting with us, aren't you? So yeah, next week on Tuesday during the technical review. OK, can you invite me there? Yeah, OK. Yeah, but if you feel comfortable, OK, if you don't feel comfortable, I understand. Don't worry. But you could, I mean, yeah, I'd really like to see that. Yeah, I'm excited about it and it's. I can just imagine this is a culmination, right, because at some point it's like showing that all the things that you have been doing since the beginning of the year. But we are in December right now, man. Yeah. And the entire year is crazy. Well, yeah, it is wild. A lot of time has gone by. And I think really like Michal leaving and then working with Varsamis to, you know, it was a huge, like mental, like. Hurdle for me to like to work through that, and I'm feeling like I'm starting to get back up on my feet and because it's been because Varsamis is actually like putting in his his his best efforts, like with what is arguably like a less than ideal, you know, thing that has been left for him. So I'm trying to match his efforts as much as I can, because. Yeah, you know, I agree with you, I'm really happy with Varsamis and the team, I feel like he's helped me a lot in a lot of things where we can like really lead in the technical discussion, really lead the discussion. And he has this mentorship that is really cool and really good to work between different time zones because you have just one task to do, you need to do the task and then show the results. And yeah, that is amazing. And I really love the idea to have Michal and Varsamis working together, right? Because that would be great. Yeah, the yin and the yang, the yin and the yang, right? Like, yeah, because I had this discussion with Michal for a year about let's start doing sprints, let's start, I don't know, working differently and he was saying, no, OK, it's too much for me, I don't know if I can do it, blah, blah, blah, blah. I didn't completely understand, OK, because you have it or you don't have it or you want it or you don't want it, right? So it's cool. So having Varsamis in the team, it was like it really changed everything. Yeah. And he's really quick at understanding the things, right? Because if we had to look for and sell out SRE for us, it would take longer. Yeah, we would have been set back much further than we would. We were set back, no doubt. But I think we're starting to climb out of the lack of progress, like we've gotten back to ground level and now building up from there. So I'm feeling good about it. And just I think just a little bit overwhelmed and it helps to just be able to vent this to you, to be honest, like because otherwise, like nobody else really understands, like in my home life, like a friend, nobody wants to listen to that. So I try not to complain about it, but it does it does it does affect me. So, yeah, but listen, if you have the need to talk with me, you don't need to wait for one-on-one, just meet me over the phone, we can do like a quick chat for example, that's okay, man. But yeah, actually, whenever you need help or you need to talk to someone, just ping us over the phone and we can talk. That is not a problem. I just put a one-on-one every two weeks because I don't want to overwhelm you and the person to keep talking about everything because we have like 10 meetings in a week about technical things. So if you want to talk about how you feel and if I can help you, of course, I will do that. I don't have any issues with that. That is something that I really like to do because I feel like you have to have a good balance between work and how you feel about the work. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and if you feel good about the work, you are going to work even better. So I'm a believer of that and I try to have that the whole team that I have to manage in the past, I had to. So, yeah, and again, try to balance, OK? Yeah, I know that you are working so hard, but try to balance. Yesterday I spoke with Nick and I told him the same. He was with COVID and he was working. So, man, try to balance and don't need to work so hard, OK? I know that we have some things that need to be done. But if you are feeling bad, if you need some time to think or just to relax, take some time to do that, OK? Yeah. Remember, the week between holidays, I would like to have that as a free week for all of you. So we are not going to introduce any new changes. We are not going to do anything. And take those days for you, OK? Don't request a video, just take those days for you. I guess that the on-call is going to be quiet that week. So, yeah, try to rest, try to think, because if you have time to think in other things that are not from the work that we have.



Sure, here's a short summary for your GitHub pull request:

---

Certainly! Here's a concise bulleted list for your GitHub pull request summary:

---

* **Issue**: Encountered `InstanceConfigureException` for unsupported platforms (like 'speech'), as per logs: [SRE UI | Log instance-configure for task SpeechProvisionInstance - dhl - Task prov-zysyhtuabfimnab](https://sre-provisioning-api.eng.medallia.com/ui/log/prov-zysyhtuabfimnab/instance-configure)
* **Root Cause**: The method `determine_helm_chart_version` raised an exception when it didn't find a helm chart version for certain platforms. In this case `speech`
* **Solution**: Updated the method to return `None` for platforms without a defined helm chart version, instead of raising an exception.
* **Benefit**: This update prevents critical errors during the instance configuration step and supports a wider range of platforms.
