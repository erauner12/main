# Thursday - January 25th 2024








Based on a comment from Juan on the document, I explored the how we could potnetially leverage Helm Value Injection (effectively decoupling the chart definition from the values in deployment repos) in Argo CD Applications without ApplicationSets


What I investigated the possibility of specifically is injecting Helm values into individual Applications. The key difference here is the direct pointing of each Application at a specific `values.yaml` file, instead of using a git generator.  
`apps/dcr/overlays/yul1/systemdcrtest2/values.yaml`

```yaml
source:
    path: apps/dcr
    repoURL: git@github.medallia.com:erauner/test-helm.git
    targetRevision: HEAD # or specific branch/tag
    helm:
      releaseName: 'dcr-<your-name>'
      valueFiles:
        - apps/dcr/overlays/yul1/systemdcrtest2/values.yaml
```

Vs

```yaml
...
generators:
    - git:
        repoURL: git@github.medallia.com:Atlas/deployment.git
        revision: master
        files:
          - path: "apps/dcr/overlays/yul1/**/values.yaml"
```

## Findings

**Direct Pointing to `values.yaml`**:
- I considered the approach of having each Application point directly to a specific `values.yaml` file.
- Reference: [Gist link](https://github.medallia.com/gist/erauner/9f6f7c55987f13a0c14c66da0aa3a55d#file-yul1-appset-test-yaml-L13-L18)

**Challenges with Multiple Sources**:
- Initially, I doubted the feasibility of this approach without using the feature documented [here](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/multiple_sources/).
- Example configuration snippet:

 ```yaml
 source:
   path: apps/dcr
   repoURL: git@github.medallia.com:erauner/test-helm.git
   targetRevision: HEAD # or specific branch/tag
   helm:
	 releaseName: 'dcr-<express cluster>'
	 valueFiles:
	   - apps/dcr/overlays/yul1/systemdcrtest2/values.yaml
 ```

   - However, using multiple repositories for Helm value files seems to be a limitation in our current setup.

**Feature in Argo CD v2.6**:
- The feature enabling multiple sources was released in Argo CD v2.6, as seen in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/10432).
- Our current version in DEN is `v2.5.6`, which lacks this capability.
- Reference: [[RMT-22000] Upgrade ArgoCD to v2.5.6 in DEN - Medallia](https://jira.medallia.com/browse/RMT-22000)


**Current Limitations**:
   - Confirmation that the `sources` field is not present in our version:
 ```shell
 kubectl explain application -n argocd --recursive=true --context den | grep source
...
Application is a definition of Application resource.
      subresource	<string>
    resourceVersion	<string>
      resources	<[]Object>
      source	<Object>
    source	<Object> -requiredsource	<Object>
          resources	<[]Object>
          source	<Object>
        resources	<[]Object>
        source	<Object>
    resourceHealthSource	<string>
    resources	<[]Object>
    sourceType	<string>
        source	<Object> -required-
 ```
   - Thus, decoupling the Helm repo from the values' locations is feasible only through the use of `ApplicationSet` in our current version.

**Recommendations:**
- Consider updating to Argo CD v2.6 for enhanced flexibility with multiple sources.
- In the interim, continue using ApplicationSet for cases where decoupling is required.


My opinion is that even if we were on version 2.6, that the method of using application sets is more straightforward.
