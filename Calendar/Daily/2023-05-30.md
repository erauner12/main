## Affirmations

> One of the simplest mindset shifts you can make to find greater success is simply to extend your time horizon. Measure your major decisions not in months or years but decades. Do that consistently and you will be amazed where you end up.

> What if you were optimizing your life for 10 years in the future instead of this month or this year? How would your behaviors change? What new decisions would you make?

> Take one area of your life that you’ve been optimizing for the short term and reorient your measurement of success for the long term.
- think in terms of where you will be in 10 years if you continue your small habit in this way.

# Daily Notes

I immediately caved on getting the adderall.

[[Adderall Dosage]]

It was nice to get Murtaza using the CLI that I built. Working through the issues to get it setup on his local.
- was also reached out to by Adam to add frontends. If you can get that working for him then you can get him on board and using it as well.

Remember how much you enjoyed working on achievement diaries?

It’s possible that you just have not defined your problems well enough yet. And in fact if you did, you would find the motivation to work towards them easier [*](https://app.napkin.one/t/-NWihtWUNfJrdDoRLOLp) #napkin_idea
