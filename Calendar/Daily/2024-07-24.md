# Wednesday - July 24th 2024

Certainly! I'll provide you with examples of how to exclude directories at different levels based on the tree structure you've shared. These examples will show you how to use the `--exclude` flag we added to the script.

1. Excluding top-level directories:

To exclude the `doc` and `local_dev` directories:

```
python3 script.py --exclude doc local_dev
```

1. Excluding nested directories:

To exclude the `lib/clients` and `lib/mixins` directories:

```
python3 script.py --exclude lib/clients lib/mixins
```

1. Excluding deeply nested directories:

To exclude the `prov_platform/digital/DigitalExpansion` and `prov_platform/mec/MecAddFrontends` directories:

```
python3 script.py --exclude prov_platform/digital/DigitalExpansion prov_platform/mec/MecAddFrontends
```

1. Combining different levels:

You can combine exclusions at different levels. For example, to exclude the top-level `tests` directory, the `lib/templates` directory, and the `prov_platform/example` directory:

```
python3 script.py --exclude tests lib/templates prov_platform/example
```

1. Excluding multiple directories within the same parent:

To exclude multiple directories within `prov_platform`, such as `digital`, `exec`, and `speech`:

```
python3 script.py --exclude prov_platform/digital prov_platform/exec prov_platform/speech
```

1. Using wildcards (if supported by your script):

If you've implemented wildcard support in your script, you could use patterns like this:

```
python3 script.py --exclude "prov_platform/*/templates"
```

This would exclude all `templates` directories within any subdirectory of `prov_platform`.

Remember that the script will still show these excluded directories in the tree view, but it won't process their contents or include them in the concatenated output file. This approach allows you to see the overall structure while focusing on specific parts of your project.

When using these commands, make sure you're in the correct directory (the root of your project structure) when running the script. Also, note that the exact behavior might depend on how you've implemented the exclusion logic in your script. The examples assume that the script correctly handles both relative and absolute paths within the project structure.

Here's the updated markdown version with the content broken down into steps and using code blocks appropriately:

## PR Description Example

### Step 1: Jira Ticket Creation and Approval

- A Jira ticket `SRECONFIG-2805` was created successfully.
- The ticket was approved, and the task will be automatically submitted shortly.

### Step 2: Testing Procedure

- Evan Rauner initiated a test to replace the prod deployer bounce with a regular delete pod and wait until BOOTING.

### Step 3: Automation Submission

- Automation submitted for Jira ticket `SRECONFIG-2805`.
- Customer: `demodcrtest4`
- Assignee: Evan Rauner
- Task: `automation-hqc211dw29xyubs`
- Notified users: Evan Rauner, acheng, sre_l1

### Step 4: Starting Status Check

Evan Rauner provided the initial status of the Classic Frontends:

```plaintext
Classic Frontends
    demodcrtest4-fe1                   : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e689.155 ready           5f5e3be35f5e3be3
    demodcrtest4-fe2                   : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e689.155 ready           5f5e3be35f5e3be3
    demodcrtest4-fe3                   : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e689.155 ready           5f5e3be35f5e3be3
```
````

## Step 5: Pod Status Update

Evan Rauner reported the current status of the pods:

```plaintext
demodcrtest4-fe1                                    2/2     Terminating   0          73m     10.197.10.113    den-r16-u25   <none>           <none>
demodcrtest4-fe2                                    2/2     Running       0          9d      10.197.10.114    den-r11-u32   <none>           <none>
demodcrtest4-fe3                                    2/2     Running       0          9d      10.197.10.115    den-r15-u28   <none>           <none>
```

## Step 6: Status After Pod Termination

Status after the termination of `demodcrtest4-fe1`:

```plaintext
Classic Frontends
    demodcrtest4-fe1                   : DOWN            invisible  not sync  unreachable     org.apache.thrift.TApplicationException
    demodcrtest4-fe2                   : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e689.155 ready           5f5e3be35f5e3be3
    demodcrtest4-fe3                   : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e689.155 ready           5f5e3be35f5e3be3
```

## Step 7: Pod Deletion and Recreation Log

Logs indicating the deletion and recreation of the pod:

```plaintext
2024-07-24 22:18:05,171 INFO utils Pod demodcrtest4-fe1 has been successfully deleted and recreated in namespace tenant-124634-prod.
2024-07-24 22:18:05,172 DEBUG k8s_client closing k8s client
2024-07-24 22:18:05,174 INFO step_dcr_farm_trigger_cache_rebuild Waiting for cache rebuild to start on node: demodcrtest4-fe1
```

## Step 8: Cache Rebuild Status Check

Logs indicating the status of the cache rebuild:

```plaintext
2024-07-24 22:18:21,917 DEBUG step_dcr_farm_trigger_cache_rebuild Current cache rebuild status for demodcrtest4-fe1: DcrStatus.ERROR
2024-07-24 22:18:21,918 DEBUG misc got exception step 'StepDCRFarmTriggerCacheRebuild' failed in '_is_rebuild_starting' with: Rebuild not yet started. Current status: DcrStatus.ERROR, sleeping for retry
```

## Step 9: Explanation of Improvement

Evan Rauner explained the improvement:

> Now we won't pass the step until the node is in BOOTING, so in case we have to re-trigger multiple times, we can do it via retry of the step instead of manually. This was not possible with the prod deployer.

## Step 10: Final Status Check

Final status of the Classic Frontends:

```plaintext
Classic Frontends
    demodcrtest4-fe1                   : BOOTING         invisible  not sync e689.155 waiting         Inactive
    demodcrtest4-fe2                   : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e689.155 ready           5f5e3be35f5e3be3
    demodcrtest4-fe3                   : SYNCHRONIZED    visible    sync     e689.155 ready           5f5e3be35f5e3be3
```

```

```
