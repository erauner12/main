# Rollover

# Daily Notes


Grateful for:

Meeting two guys at the gym this morning, had a good conversation.

The new gym itself. I think it will be a great place to start building myself back up again.

Grateful to have the way that I feel about things explained and validated by an expert who has seen so many cases of this thing.
