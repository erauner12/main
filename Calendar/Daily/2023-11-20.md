 Maybe this also could be another one, the event mapping. Because we kind of know we want to use configuration repo, right? Yeah. And then maybe the Slack, because we have already for Slack, at least. And it's a good thing, I think, if we have a Slack up to, at least in the beginning, to write to some dummy channel and see what they're doing. Yeah, yeah, I agree. OK. Yeah, we kind of have things to do. Yeah, definitely. This we're going to span across multiple quarters, I guess. Yeah, for sure. Plus, we know the other thing is we need to get started a new repository, or make change to the one you had. Yeah. Because we need to think of the structure a bit better. Yeah, yeah, I agree. And also, sorry to interrupt. We can design it ahead. We can design it as a package, a Python package. And then what we do is, if we want to split those two, we just say, OK, install this package as a dependency here, and we use what we need. And install as a dependency here, and we will use what we need. Oh, nice. We make it portable, so we keep the code in one place. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, yeah, OK. So see, there is things we can do tomorrow. OK. All right, anything else? Not really. OK, then we can take 10 minutes back, I guess. OK. And Evan, you're clear in what I was saying about the security task thing, right? Yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying now. And if you want to, if you have a meeting with the chief or whatever, he's leaving, right? He is leaving, yeah. He's leaving the company, right? Yeah. But he was also a good one. Anyway, yeah, if you want to, you can circle us in. But of course, if it's later in the day, I wouldn't want to. Yeah. OK, thanks, guys. Yeah, thanks for this. Thank you. Bye. Bye.

- On **2023-11-16**, a **TypeError** was encountered in the Python script `/provision/step.py` at line 154.
- This error was caused by attempting to write a `NoneType` data type to a file, which can only accept strings.
- The error was encountered during the initialization of the `StepDbPgScripts` step from image `202311151125-SREPROVNG-276-6770e9b` with `sre_python_library 0.7.13+20230821202030.master.e1ef3eb`.
- The code attempted to write the secret `self.config.identity.secret` to the file `/usr/lib64/python3.9/pathlib.py` using the `write_text` function.
