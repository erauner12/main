What I'm getting at is not quite ==understanding the point== of setting up so many tools to help achieve clarity, while still fumbling around and not being able to easily see what you're actually trying to accomplish. I don't want that to be the case. [[understanding the point|â†—]] ^afbgxs

I want to be able to see something that actually makes sense. I think what makes sense is to know what you don't want, but remain open to discovering what you might find that you do want.
