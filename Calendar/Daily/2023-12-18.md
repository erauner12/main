[Pass parameters from ApplicationSet from dedicated file by erauner 路 Pull Request #51477 路 Atlas/deployment](https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/deployment/pull/51477/files)

[ArgoCD at scale with ApplicationSet & Go Template | by Geoffrey | Medium](https://medium.com/@geoffrey.muselli/argocd-at-scale-with-applicationset-go-template-7f326d8a61f3)



```
kubectl delete applicationset dcr-tenants -n argocd --context den --grace-period=0 --force
```


Given your specific use case where you're using a Git generator in an Argo CD ApplicationSet to target `values.yaml` files in a directory structure like `apps/dcr/customers/prod/**/`, let's see how each of these placeholders would resolve:

1. `{{.path.path}}`: This will resolve to the full path of the `values.yaml` file relative to the root of your Git repository. For example, if your ApplicationSet is processing the file at `apps/dcr/customers/prod/systemdcrtest1/values.yaml`, then `{{.path.path}}` would be exactly that: `apps/dcr/customers/prod/systemdcrtest1/values.yaml`.
2. `{{.path.basename}}`: This extracts the last part of the path, which in the context of your directory structure, is the name of the directory containing the `values.yaml` file. So, for `apps/dcr/customers/prod/systemdcrtest1/values.yaml`, `{{.path.basename}}` would be `systemdcrtest1`.
3. `{{.path.filename}}`: This will give you the name of the file, including its extension, at the end of the path. In your case, since you're specifically targeting `values.yaml` files, `{{.path.filename}}` will always be `values.yaml`.
4. `{{.path.basenameNormalized}}`: This is a normalized version of `basename`. Normalization typically involves modifying the string to remove special characters, convert to a standard case (like lowercase), etc. The exact nature of normalization depends on Argo CD's implementation, but it will be a normalized form of the directory name. For `systemdcrtest1`, if normalization doesn't change the format, it would remain `systemdcrtest1`.
5. `{{.path.filenameNormalized}}`: This is a normalized version of the filename. Again, the specific normalization rules depend on Argo CD's implementation, but it's generally a safe version of the filename. Since `values.yaml` is already quite standard, it likely would remain `values.yaml` after normalization.

To summarize, in your context:
