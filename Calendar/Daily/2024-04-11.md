# Thursday - April 11th 2024

Previous runs if there are any

Invalid certificate in yul1

Need to make the certificate available in other namespaces.

Need Murtaza to make this available

https://sretesthelmcolo.medallia.ca/

Perhaps it is possible at this point to just kubectl apply to test the ingress template against sretestsmf1  
and skip the lbaas step on the provision.

[[SREPROVNG-544] Provision test express instance in SMF1 - Medallia](https://jira.medallia.com/browse/SREPROVNG-544)

I think it should actually work the same way in smf1 as it did in den because they are both \*.medallia.com

Are they going to move the netscaler to yul1

Reach out to Lean about the kafkfa step  
Lean reached back out:

A ticket is being worked on to deploy a Kafka cluster for integrations in `smf1`, but it is not yet completed. I requested the ticket to be linked to their own and suggests skipping this step for now since it is a test cluster.

Skip the step and proceed if you can.
