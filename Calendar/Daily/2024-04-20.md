# Saturday - April 20th 2024

So what I want to do is setup a dedicated memos server just for interacting with for work and side projects.

It will contain more actionable types of notes that I am storing not long term. I will mostly be interacting with this via the API in obsidian.

Ex:

- Taking a note and turning it to a commment on todoist.
- Creating a new task off of a memo.
- Creating a new page off a memo.

â€¦

Setup the port forwarding on synology to the new one:

Port: `5232`

[[Memos]]
