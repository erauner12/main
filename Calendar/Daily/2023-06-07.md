PSYCHOLOGY TRICKS:
- If someone insults you, pause for a second and look at them and say "are you okay?"
- If you think someone is lying, look at their eyes and don't say anything.
- If you're in an argument, keep your voice calm, it'll give them the impression that you're winning the argument.
- Good posture increases confidence. spread your body out and take up more space, it'll lead to increased confidence.
- Your eyes dilate when talking to a person you love.
- If you're not following me you're probably never going to see me again. If you are, congratulations; you're growing mentally everyday.
