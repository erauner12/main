# Daily Notes



The failure you're experiencing in the workflow seems to be related to an operation involving the creation of a DNS record (specifically a CNAME record) using a custom system, which appears to involve a process named `daas` (perhaps an internal DNS as a Service tool).

Here's a breakdown of what might be causing the issue:

1. **Operation Failure in DaaS System:** The key part of the error is the `DaasException` that indicates the operation to create a DNS record failed. This failure occurs in the `wait_for_op` method, which suggests that the process is waiting for the operation to complete and then encounters an error.
2. **Record Creation Issue:** The specific operation that fails is the creation of a CNAME record for `ihg` in the `medallia.com` zone, pointing to `lb.sc4.medallia.com.`. The failure of this operation might be due to several reasons:
   - Incorrect or already existing DNS record: If the CNAME record you're trying to create already exists or conflicts with existing records, it could lead to a failure.
   - Permission or Access Issues: There might be insufficient permissions or other access-related issues in the DaaS system or the underlying DNS infrastructure.
   - System Constraints or Limitations: There might be limitations or constraints within the DaaS system that are causing the operation to fail, such as rate limiting, validation errors, or system unavailability.

3. **Repeated Attempts:** The workflow attempts this operation multiple times, all resulting in failure. This repetition suggests that the issue is consistent and not a transient network or service interruption.
4. **Error Handling and Propagation:** The exception handling in your code correctly catches the `DaasException` but does not seem to resolve the underlying issue, leading to the eventual `AbstractStepException` which indicates a failure in the DNS provisioning step.

To address this issue, consider the following steps:

- **Review DNS Configuration:** Double-check the DNS record you're trying to create. Ensure there are no conflicts or errors in the record itself.
- **Check DaaS System Logs/Status:** Investigate the logs or status reports of the DaaS system to understand why the operation is failing. Look for detailed error messages or codes that can offer more insight.
- **Verify Permissions and Access:** Ensure that the system or user performing the operation has the necessary permissions and access rights.
- **Consult Documentation or Support:** If the DaaS system is a third-party service or an internal tool with documentation, consult the relevant materials or contact support for more guidance.
- **Error Handling in Code:** Enhance the error handling in your code to better manage these exceptions and possibly provide more informative error messages or recovery steps.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, you might need to dig deeper into the specifics of your DaaS implementation and the environment in which your provisioning script runs.

sounds like we need to override some of the behavior in this step (`MecAddFrontEnds`):

right now it is just doing the same thing as `MecProvisionInstance`

## Title
Fix DNS Provisioning Bug in MecAddFrontEnds Step

## Description

**Issue:**  
The current implementation of the `MecAddFrontEnds` step in our provisioning process is incorrectly attempting to create a CNAME record for `ihg.medallia.com`, which already exists. This behavior is redundant and leads to failures in the DNS provisioning process, it would have already happened in `MecProvisionInstance`.

**Expected Behavior:**  
The `MecAddFrontEnds` step should be tailored to handle the provisioning of new Front-End (FE) nodes only, avoiding attempts to recreate existing CNAME records like `ihg.medallia.com`.
- Only `A` records are needed for the new frontend nodes

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Execute the provisioning process involving `MecAddFrontEnds`.
2. Observe the failure in creating an existing CNAME record for `ihg.medallia.com`.

**Suggested Fix:**
- Modify the `MecAddFrontEnds` step in the `provisioning-ng/step_dns_external.py` script to ensure it only creates DNS A records for new FE nodes.
- Implement a validation check to confirm whether a DNS record already exists before attempting creation.
- Align the DNS provisioning logic in `MecAddFrontEnds` to be distinct and appropriate for FE nodes, differentiating it from the `MecProvisionInstance` step.

**Impact:**
- This bug is causing unnecessary failures in the DNS provisioning process, leading to delays in the deployment of new FE nodes.
