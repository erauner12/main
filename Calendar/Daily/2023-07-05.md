## Journal

Q: How did I feel physically today?  
A: Felt pretty good I would say. Did not work out though

Q: What did I do to be the change I want to see in the world?  
A: Actually made the time to work on my writing system. Even though it’s not a perfect process yet, I finally just took the actual time to just go through the mistakes that it takes to get a process together.

Q: What could I have done to make today even better?  
A: I think that I probably could have done a better job at trying to do something related to Work.

The reason I was unable to is because yesterday was July 4 and I just didn’t really feel like doing anything because I know that nobody was actually going to do anything

> Sometimes just pausing to think "why don't I want to do this" and realizing "oh, it's entirely my social anxiety" is a great motivator to go "well rationally there's nothing but my own ego holding my back, so screw it – time to commit and do this!"

the freedom to let go of stress when it is no longer useful. analogy to working out.

you don’t continue to stress yourself when you are not working out? you should not identify with every thought that comes into consciousness

[Your relationships are your most profound teacher.   “The point of finding a partner who is a good healthy match isn’t so you can enjoy a carefree partnership that doesn’t trigger your relationship issues…  No.  The point is to find someone who feels safe enough being triggered by so you can do the hard work of breaking unhealthy relationship patterns   & face your demons, together.”](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CrL1ekSPL7Z/)
