Copy title of note?
* Out of the `title` property in note metadata


---


Prompt to create first task when project note is created?
* Can either use the title or something else
* Actually create the task and reference it in the same way as if taskbone created it.
* Then you can create a subtask immediately off of that.


---


Have a way to make a note
* In case you want to make it a project item after the fact.
* Ex: your refactored the note to begin with and realize now that you want to make it into something.
* Instead of having to decide from the get go.

I feel like I want to also similarly have a way to see the focus from my iphone as well. Like as a [[Scriptable]] widget or something.
