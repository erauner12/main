> One of the simplest mindset shifts you can make to find greater success is simply to extend your time horizon. Measure your major decisions not in months or years but decades. Do that consistently and you will be amazed where you end up.

> What if you were optimizing your life for 10 years in the future instead of this month or this year? How would your behaviors change? What new decisions would you make?

> Take one area of your life that you’ve been optimizing for the short term and reorient your measurement of success for the long term.

# Daily Notes


---

Aaron reached out about AI first thing when I woke up

---

So today I tried doing my mediation outside in the kid morning. It felt really good.

I think the reason it felt good is because it was on the morning while I still had energy.

---

In my meditation today, I recognized when I opened my eyes that this external stimuli is equivalent to the internal thoughts.

Just appearances in consciousness of my head.

---

Something I want to try is removing these prompts to do the dishes and laundry.

Instead I’d like to just have my timers ready

And insert times that I would respond to these things into my day. Such as doing dishes while waiting for my meal to cook.
- [x] remind yourself to push the needle on laundry/dishes around 4pm and in the morning. ✅ 2023-09-01

What I don’t have a great cue for yet is laundry.

I think laundry should started in the morning and use a timer to remind yourself to follow up on it.

And in terms of actually folding it, that should probably be done at some point at the end of the day while you’re listening to a podcast

---

I’ve done so many things today. Specifically things I was not keen on doing.

But I forced myself to do them because I know that I wanted to get them done.

I am so happy I now have a place to record my experience as I start completing these things that I’ve always known I was capable of doing.

---

try hitting reset button on disposal

---

try boggling teeth with a broomstick

---

pull everything from underneath disposal

---

Call insurance to get sink disposal fixed (make sure it is covered)

---

I want to start cooking my meals all at once for the week again. Perhaps 5 meals at a time. Starting on Sunday so that I’m prepared for the week
