# Saturday - March 23rd 2024

I am creating a vision board for myself, there are 3 images on the board. Help me create a meaningful connection of these three ideas:

The idea is to create a feedback loop that involves experimenting with different things in life that you have not allowed yourself to do before.

1st:

"Do it Scared"

2nd:

"The words you speak become the houes you live in"

3rd:

"No more waiting to become. It's time to simply be."

â€¦

What I'd like to do is to encourage myself to leverage reflections and just letting it happen instead of trying to control things. Instead of finding ways to procrastinate this process. I would like to turn this into actually applying things that I learn in my life immediately. Start by trying it/doing it instead of intellectualizing it.

The three images on your vision board create a powerful and interconnected message that encourages personal growth, self-expression, and living authentically in the present moment. Let's explore how these ideas work together to create a meaningful feedback loop:

1. "Do it Scared": This message encourages you to step out of your comfort zone and embrace new experiences, even when they feel intimidating. By facing your fears and trying new things, you open yourself up to personal growth and discovery. This is the starting point of the feedback loop, where you take action despite your apprehensions.
2. "The words you speak become the house you live in": This quote highlights the power of your thoughts and words in shaping your reality. By speaking positively and authentically, you create an environment that supports your growth and well-being. As you "do it scared" and engage in new experiences, be mindful of the words you use to describe those experiences. Embrace a language that uplifts and empowers you, reinforcing the positive aspects of your journey.
3. "No more waiting to become. It's time to simply be.": This final message ties the feedback loop together by emphasizing the importance of living in the present moment. Instead of waiting for some future point where you feel fully ready or "perfect," embrace the idea that you are already enough. By applying the lessons you learn in real-time, you create a continuous cycle of growth and self-discovery.

To turn this vision board into action, focus on implementing small changes consistently. When you learn something new, find a way to apply it in your life, no matter how small the application may seem. Celebrate your progress and the courage it takes to try new things. As you continue to "do it scared," speak kindly to yourself, and embrace the present moment, you'll create a powerful feedback loop that propels you forward on your personal growth journey.

Remember, personal growth is an ongoing process. Be patient with yourself, and trust that each step you take, no matter how small, contributes to your overall development. By consistently applying the principles represented on your vision board, you'll cultivate a mindset that embraces change, authenticity, and living life to the fullest.

At what point does reflection occur?

Reflection is a crucial component of the feedback loop and can occur at multiple points throughout the process. Here's how reflection can be incorporated:

1. Before "doing it scared": Take a moment to reflect on what has been holding you back from trying new things. Identify the fears or limiting beliefs that have prevented you from stepping out of your comfort zone. This reflection sets the stage for taking action and helps you develop self-awareness.
2. During the experience: As you engage in new experiences, practice mindfulness and reflect on your thoughts, emotions, and reactions in real-time. Notice how you feel, what you're learning, and any challenges you encounter. This in-the-moment reflection allows you to make adjustments and stay present throughout the experience.
3. After the experience: Once you've completed a new activity or faced a fear, take time to reflect on the experience as a whole. Consider what you learned about yourself, what you enjoyed, and what you found challenging. Reflect on how the experience aligns with your values and goals, and consider how you can apply any lessons learned to future experiences.
4. When speaking to yourself: As you process your experiences and engage in self-talk, reflect on the words you use. Are they aligned with the positive, empowering message of your vision board? If not, take a moment to reframe your thoughts and words to better support your growth and well-being.
5. When considering next steps: Reflect on how you can continue to apply the lessons learned in your daily life. Consider what actions you can take to build upon your progress and maintain the momentum of your personal growth journey.

By incorporating reflection at various points throughout the feedback loop, you create opportunities for self-awareness, learning, and continuous improvement. Reflection allows you to internalize the experiences you have and integrate them into your personal growth journey. It also helps you stay connected to your vision board's messages, ensuring that you remain authentic, present, and committed to your development.
