## Working On

I should create a task to investigate this Whisperboard repository. Since it's open source, I want to evaluate if it can provide the same functionality without paying the Superwhisper fee. I have about 30 days from October 26th before needing to decide on the $250 payment. I'm not opposed to paying if it provides sufficient value, but I want to explore all available options.

I want to set up a custom action in Inbox AI that sends questions directly to ChatGPT. I'm looking through the documentation to understand how to implement this. I see sections about Flow Control, Next Action Field, Built-in Actions, and Custom Actions. The Next Action Field with AI appears to be special, and there's information about making API requests. How do I create terms and set this up correctly?

What should we do about this?

---

I'd like to try making this work the way that I think it can.

Any other suggestions you might have?

here was a recent result, do you think it was giving a proper amount of time in between each task
```

```
Extract and organize tasks from natural language input, creating a hierarchical structure that reflects both priority and logical grouping.

1. Task Format:
   Main tasks: "- [ ] Task description // TIMING PRIORITY"
   Subtasks:   "  * Subtask description // TIMING"
   Comments:   "  - Comment or detail"

2. Task Organization Logic (in order):
   a) Urgency Assessment:
      - Critical blockers and immediate needs (p1)
      - Time-sensitive requirements (p2)
      - Regular tasks (p3/p4)

   b) Logical Grouping:
      - Group related tasks under a single main task
      - Use subtasks for distinct steps needing timing
      - Use comments for details/notes
      - Maximum 2 levels deep (main task → subtask)

3. Time Allocation:
   Quick Actions (15 minutes):
   - Simple, single-focus tasks
   - Basic preparation steps
   - Quick communications

   Standard Tasks (30 minutes):
   - Multi-step processes
   - Basic troubleshooting
   - Focused work segments

   Extended Tasks (1 hour):
   - Complex processes
   - Multiple subtasks
   - Detailed work

   Project Tasks (2+ hours):
   - Major undertakings
   - Multiple phases
   - Unknown complexity

4. Priority Levels:
   p1 (Urgent):
   - Blocking issues
   - Safety/functionality concerns
   - Immediate attention needed

   p2 (Important):
   - Time-sensitive but not blocking
   - Prevention/maintenance
   - Scheduled commitments

   p3 (Normal):
   - Regular tasks
   - Flexible timing
   - General improvements

   p4 (Low):
   - Optional tasks
   - Nice-to-have items
   - No time pressure

5. Task Structure Guidelines:
   - Main task timing should encompass all subtasks
   - Subtasks should have individual timing if tracked separately
   - Use comments for context that doesn't need timing
   - Keep related tasks together
   - Avoid task switching when possible
   - Order subtasks logically within main task

Example:
- [ ] Fix urgent plumbing issue // in 1h p1
  - Assess situation // in 15m
    - Check for water damage
    - Identify leak source
  - Attempt repair // in 30m
    - Gather tools
    - Make repair
  - Test and cleanup // in 15m
    - Verify fix works
    - Clean area
  - Call plumber if needed
  - Document solution

Notes:
- Always consider dependencies between tasks
- Group related tasks together
- Use subtasks for trackable steps
- Use comments for context/details
- Keep structure clear and logical
- Avoid excessive nesting
```

```javascript
// Create a to-do in Todoist for each found Markdown style to-do in the draft
// Sub-bullets under a task will be added as separate comments to preserve task relationships
// You can include Todoist context options like priority and timing after //
// Timing can be specific (today 2pm) or relative (in 30 minutes)
// Priority ranges from p1 (highest) to p4 (lowest)
// Sample To-dos:
// - [ ] Update website header // in 30 minutes p1
//   - Review current design
//   - Check mobile responsiveness
//   - Get feedback from team
// - [ ] Strategic planning // tomorrow 10am p2
//   - Define quarterly goals
//   - Review resources

// Function to create a comment for each bullet point
function createTaskComments(todoistTask, notes) {
	for (let note of notes) {
		todoist.createComment({
			task_id: todoistTask.id,
			content: note,
		});
	}
}

// Main processing loop
let lines = draft.content.split("\n");
let todoist = Todoist.create();
let ctErrors = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
	let line = lines[i];
	if (line.trim().startsWith("- [ ]")) {
		let taskData = {
			title: "",
			context: "",
			notes: [],
		};

		// If line contains context options
		if (line.includes("//")) {
			let arr = line.split("//");
			taskData.title = arr[0].replace("- [ ]", "").trim();
			taskData.context = arr[1].trim();

			// Create todo text without comma
			var todo = `${taskData.title} ${taskData.context}`;
		} else {
			// Just the title if no context
			var todo = line.replace("- [ ]", "").trim();
		}

		// Collect sub-bullets as separate notes
		let currentIndex = i + 1;
		while (currentIndex < lines.length) {
			let nextLine = lines[currentIndex];
			if (nextLine.trim().startsWith("-") && nextLine.startsWith("  ")) {
				taskData.notes.push(nextLine.trim().replace("-", "").trim());
				currentIndex++;
			} else {
				break;
			}
		}
		i = currentIndex - 1;

		console.log("Creating task: " + todo); // Debug log

		// Create the task using quickAdd
		let task = todoist.quickAdd(todo);

		if (task) {
			// Create separate comments for each note
			if (taskData.notes.length > 0) {
				createTaskComments(task, taskData.notes);
			}
		} else {
			ctErrors++;
			console.log("Todoist error: " + todoist.lastError);
		}
	}
}

if (ctErrors > 0) {
	context.fail();
}
```

I want to make changes to a script + prompt that I am using to create a system for planning todoist tasks based on some arbitrary input that was transcribed.

…

the way it works now with the prompt is:

```
Extract and organize tasks from natural language input, prioritizing single-task focus and clear sequential ordering.

1. Task Format: "- [ ] Task description // TIMING PRIORITY"

2. Sequencing Principles:
   a) One Task at a Time:
      - Focus on sequential completion
      - No parallel tasks
      - Clear start and end points
      - Complete one thing before moving to next

   b) Order Determined By:
      1. Critical blockers (must be done first)
      2. Explicit urgency ("immediately", "asap")
      3. Priority level (p1 to p4)
      4. Quick enabling tasks
      5. Natural task flow

3. Duration Categories:
   Quick Actions (15 minutes):
   - Simple household tasks
   - Basic maintenance
   - Quick communications

   Standard Tasks (30 minutes):
   - Basic troubleshooting
   - Light maintenance
   - Tasks with some setup

   Focused Work (1 hour):
   - Complex repairs
   - Detailed work
   - Multiple steps

   Project Work (2+ hours):
   - Major tasks
   - Unknown complexity
   - External dependencies

4. Priority Levels:
   p1 (Urgent):
   - Immediate attention needed
   - Blocking other tasks
   - Safety/functionality issues

   p2 (Important):
   - Time-sensitive
   - Important maintenance

   p3 (Normal):
   - Routine tasks
   - General maintenance

   p4 (Low):
   - Optional improvements
   - Non-time-sensitive

Example of sequential ordering:
Original input: "Need to fix the sink (urgent), do laundry, and clean the kitchen. Sink is blocking dishes from being done."

- [ ] Clear and assess sink // in 15 minutes p1
  - Remove items from sink
  - Identify specific issue
  - Gather tools

- [ ] Fix sink // in 30 minutes p1
  - Attempt repair
  - Test functionality
  - Call plumber if needed

- [ ] Do dishes // in 30 minutes p2
  - Clean all dishes
  - Wipe down sink
  - Put dishes away

- [ ] Start laundry // in 15 minutes p3
  - Sort clothes
  - Load washer
  - Set cycle

Notes:
- Each task has clear start/end
- No overlapping tasks
- Natural progression of steps
- Realistic timing for each task
- Clear dependencies handled sequentially
```

here is an example of the most recent result.

```
- [ ] Clear and assess sink area // in 15 minutes p1
  - Remove items from under the sink
  - Clear items from inside the sink
- [ ] Get Allen wrench // in 15 minutes p1
  - Locate or purchase an Allen wrench if not on hand
- [ ] Attempt to fix the sink // in 30 minutes p1
  - Use Allen wrench to locate and press the button
  - Jog the fixture loose if needed
  - Test sink functionality
- [ ] Clean up backyard // in 30 minutes p2
  - Pick up and dispose of any waste
  - Organize any scattered items
- [ ] Clean out car trash // in 15 minutes p3
  - Gather and dispose of trash from car
  - Wipe down surfaces if needed
- [ ] Take a shower // in 15 minutes p4
  - Prepare necessary toiletries
  - Shower and dress
```

…

now that you understand this, this is how I want you to help me adjust this script, which I'll supply you with the context+ instructions in the next response.

Ok so this looks better but there is still some functionality I want to add to the thing:

here is an example of the most recent result.

"""

- [ ] Clear and assess sink area // in 15 minutes p1
    - Remove items from under the sink
    - Clear items from inside the sink
- [ ] Get Allen wrench // in 15 minutes p1
    - Locate or purchase an Allen wrench if not on hand
- [ ] Attempt to fix the sink // in 30 minutes p1
    - Use Allen wrench to locate and press the button
    - Jog the fixture loose if needed
    - Test sink functionality
- [ ] Clean up backyard // in 30 minutes p2
    - Pick up and dispose of any waste
    - Organize any scattered items
- [ ] Clean out car trash // in 15 minutes p3
    - Gather and dispose of trash from car
    - Wipe down surfaces if needed
- [ ] Take a shower // in 15 minutes p4
    - Prepare necessary toiletries
    - Shower and dress  
         """

Drafts documentation:

```
quickAdd
quickAdd(text, note?, reminder?, options?): object
Parameters
text: string
Text to use to create the task. Supports Todoist quick add notation for specifying projects, priority, labels, etc. just as if you were using the Todoist quick add window.

Optionalnote: string
Optional text to attach as a comment with the task.

Optionalreminder: string
Optional natural language date specifying for creating a task reminder.

Optionaloptions: object
Optional dictionary of additional parameters to include in the request.

Returns object
Object containing respose data from Todoist.
```

- do you see that last optional dictionary of parameters, I think that could be leveraged
- I believe we can pass the parent_id through the options parameter in quickAdd

- Additionally, I would like to explore the possibility of adding a feature for supplying comments directly to the project.
- Support relative and absolute times in the prompt
- Project structure should adhere to the kanban

```
I believe the next step, based on everything we've built so far, is to incorporate a method for taking inventory in the script. We are already tracking this to some extent through our task and project modeling. We need to update the draft to keep it up to date


This setup will allow me to maintain a running configuration for the project. I should be able to add new tasks while keeping the already created ones in place. When the script runs, it will manipulate the tasks accordingly. The schema I have for this project structure will facilitate storing this set of tasks in a way that makes it easy to revisit or add to them without removing non-actionable tasks from the draft. For instance, if I accidentally delete a task, I can re-add it with all the original information.

I will provide documentation for the drafts API so you can easily update the draft and tasks. We might consider making these adjustments as we process each task, but I'm unsure when the best time to do this would be. Regardless, I want every task in this file to be updated to reflect the latest state when I run the task again. This way, I won't have to worry about accidentally duplicating tasks with the same information. I want to maintain a single file that contains all the tasks.

Could you help me create this system?

For example, we should ignore creating tasks for `- [x]`. After successfully creating a task, we should convert it at the end of the task to `- [x]`. We should use the drafts API to do this easily.


Drafts Script Reference

Class Draft
The Draft object represents a single draft. When an action is run, the current draft is available as the global variable draft. Scripts can also create new drafts, access and set values, and update the draft to persist changes.

Example
Creating a draft

// create a new draft, assign content and save it
let d = new Draft();
d.content = "My new draft";
d.addTag("personal");
d.update();
Copy
Querying drafts

// query a list of drafts in the inbox with the tag "blue"
let drafts = Draft.query("", "inbox", ["blue"])

Variable draftConst
draft: Draft
When an action is run, a single draft is always in context and accessible via the draft const. This usually points to the draft loaded in the editor at the time the action was run if running actions from the action list or action bar.

Returns object
update
update(): void
Save changes made to the draft to the database. update() must be called to save changes made to a draft.

Returns void
Static
create
create(): Draft
Create a new draft object. This is an in-memory object only, unless "update()" is called to save the draft.

...

Readonly
completedTasks
completedTasks: [Task]
Array of completed task lines found in the content, based on active syntax definition for the draft. See Task documentation for usage details.

Readonly
incompleteTasks
incompleteTasks: [Task]
Array of incomplete task lines found in the content, based on active syntax definition for the draft. See Task documentation for usage details.

Readonly
tasks
tasks: [Task]
Array of task lines found in the content, based on active syntax definition for the draft. See Task documentation for usage details. Includes all found tasks, regardless of status.

advanceTask
advanceTask(task): boolean
Update the text representing the task to a next valid state as defined by syntax. If this task has only two states, this is effectively a toggle, if more than two states exist, the next state will be set, including cycling around to the initial state. Note that the task object is not updated to reflect changes made.

Parameters
task: Task
Returns boolean
boolean If true, advance was successful

completeTask
completeTask(task): boolean
Update the text representing the task to a completed state as defined by syntax. Note that the task object is not updated to reflect changes made.

Parameters
task: Task
Returns boolean
boolean If true, completion was successful

resetTask
resetTask(task): boolean
Update the text representing the task to a initial state as defined by syntax. Note that the task object is not updated to reflect changes made.

Parameters
task: Task
Returns boolean
boolean If true, reset was successfu
```


```
When creating a new task or making changes to an existing one, add an **asterisk (*) and space** in front of the task’s name to make it uncompletable.

For example, if you want to create an uncompletable task called "Flight check-in", write `* Flight check-in`.

…

As a part of this change

Also, I don't think that project's have a description like this, I think the closest thing to it would either be project comments or adding uncompletable tasks to the project (which are just tasks that cannot be checked off.

Which I think might actually be a pretty great use of them tbh.

…

technically, all you need to do to add these kinds of tasks to a project is create a task the same way we already have in the code that existed before we started, except when we create it.
```


Add support for project sections?

Add support for project hierarchies?
