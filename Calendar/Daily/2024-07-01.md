# Investigate MecDeployCluster Task

## Description
We need to investigate the integration of the `MecDeployCluster` task with Slack based on the recent PR [#80](https://github.medallia.com/medallia/gesp/pull/80). This task currently uses the "as is" approach, and we need to determine if any restrictions (e.g., OCI/no-op deployments only) should be implemented. Additionally, we are exploring the use of `MecDeployCluster` to enable RM to initiate deployments directly through the UI, reducing their dependency on L1 for ad-hoc deployments and regular deployment processes.

## Context
We are considering using `MecDeployCluster` for no-op'ing a cluster in response to an unplanned GC alert and for RM-initiated deployments without L1 intervention. A key point is whether we can use it to trigger a rolling restart of all nodes without changing any express version or configuration values. This would help in scenarios where nodes need to be restarted one at a time for L1 for operational usage. But also for RM to track and manage deployments effectively without L1 unless they are need to intervene.

## Tasks
1. Review the implementation of `MecDeployCluster` in the PR [#80](https://github.medallia.com/medallia/gesp/pull/80).
2. Sync up with the team to decide on any restrictions for the task (e.g., OCI/no-op deployments only).
3. Investigate the possibility of using `MecDeployCluster` for rolling restarts without express version changes (for L1)
4. Confirm if we have the necessary parameters or switches for the task to support rolling restarts.
	1. Determine parameters to test for this
5. Update the Slack handler to integrate the `MecDeployCluster` task with any required parameters or switches.
6. Explore the feasibility of RM using `MecDeployCluster` for direct deployment management, including the replication of DEP ticket functionalities within the SRECONFIG system.
	1. Determine parameters to test this
7. Make any necessary changes to the python code to fit both of these cases
8. Test both cases and provide results
