can we also do this with the search button, we should open: just open the searchUrl the same way:

```
async function handleSearch(searchTerm, memoGrid, apiConfig) {

    const memoTable = customJS.createMemoInstance();

    memoTable.setApiConfig(apiConfig);

    const searchUrl = memoTable.getSearchUrlResults(searchTerm);

    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(searchTerm);

    window.open(searchUrl, '_blank');

}
```
