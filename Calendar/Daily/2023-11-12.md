# Rollover

# Daily Notes



I would like to begin therapy sessions every two weeks until January 24, 2024. After that, we can continue with sessions from Modern Health every 1-2 weeks until they are out, and then re-evaluate.

Can we schedule the first session for this Thursday or next, depending on your availability?
