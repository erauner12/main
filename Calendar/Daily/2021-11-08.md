# Daily Notes


## Logbook
- [x] [Metlife open enrollment requirement for invisalign](things:///show?id=PRcAND2486YusoTJJsWU7V)
	- [x] called orthodonist to leave a message (see if their end has already been paid)
	- [x] Reach out to HR to confirm
- [x] [Make sure with HR that contribution limit change still gets matched](things:///show?id=dLno2tJvKNBifwUHgLMkA)
	- [x] Also ask how close you are to reaching your maximum annual contribution
- [x] [Need to test a migraiton with using new k8s process](things:///show?id=8ebjHxNdjynA3hw3LT9HPZ)
	- [x] deploy a new tenant for testing
	- [x] Setup Yamls manually
	- [x] Try with different metadata.name , e.g. add suffix like -migration ; that might help, and of course, youâ€™ll have two set of svcs for same pod: one is your temporary svc, and another is the ordinary svc managed by express-operator.
	- [x] Make appropriate code changes
