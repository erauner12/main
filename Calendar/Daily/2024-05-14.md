## SRE API Slack Integration Errors

## Test DCR Start Farm

I want to test dcr farm so that I can see if it creates the jira properly.

Misc errors

Unsupported task type. Use /sreapi-list-tasks

- When no task type is provided on submit sre api tasks

…

Try bounce node without providing a DC

…

DC should not be required (For MEC at least)

---

Managed to create several jiras ahead of time that we need

Could really have a better process for provisioning cluster in a new DC

---

Should be easier to get feedback from prod services on our tickets.

…

- The maximum amount of time that a cache rebuild should take
- It would be helpful to know the exact criteria for when a DCR should be run. Providing more details on the length threshold that necessitates a DCR would clarify the decision-making process.

---

https://jira.medallia.com/browse/SREPROVNG-616

- Rename this jira
- Should put in the description, create a slack alert and a button which will ask the user whether or not they want to bounce the node or dismiss.

Adjust Provisioning process for adding instances to Lightning groups to use subgroups

Currently, when provisioning new Lightning instances, they are being added directly to the main "dep-lightning" group. However, the deployment process has been updated to use Lightning subgroups (dep-lightning1, dep-lightning2, etc.)

We need to adjust the provisioning process to add new instances to the appropriate Lightning subgroup instead of the main "dep-lightning" group.

[provisioning-ng/prov_platform/mec/MecProvisionInstance/step_lightning.py at master · medallia/provisioning-ng](https://github.medallia.com/medallia/provisioning-ng/blob/master/prov_platform/mec/MecProvisionInstance/step_lightning.py)

Example of current Lightning groups:

- dep-lightning (main group)
    - dep-lightning1 (subgroup)
    - dep-lightning2 (subgroup)
    - …

Ex:

[clusterconfig-sc4/defs.xml at master · DeployerConfig/clusterconfig-sc4](https://github.medallia.com/DeployerConfig/clusterconfig-sc4/blob/master/defs.xml)

```
<plan name="dep-lightning" parallel="true" description="Deploy lightning instances using the config service">

...

<plan name="dep-lightning1" parallel="true" description="Deploy lightning instances using the config service">
…
<plan name="dep-lightning1-force" parallel="true" description="Deploy lightning instances using the config service">
…
<plan name="dep-lightning2" parallel="true" description="Deploy lightning instances using the config service">
…
<plan name="dep-lightning2-force" parallel="true" description="Deploy lightning instances using the config service">
```

Action Items:

1. Update provisioning process to add new Lightning instances to appropriate subgroups
