## Journal

Was today a good day?

* Generally, would you say today was good or no?

wtagd:: yeah it was ok. Did not get much done again though.  

---

What excited me?

* What excited you today?

**wem**:: I was able to get my old iPad setup to use as a way to stick to my calendar more easily.  

---

What drained me of energy?

* Did you spin your wheels on anything

doe:: cannot think of anything in particular.

---

What have I learned?

* Did you learn anything?

whil:: I learned how to leverage the sre api in a new way that helped me fix a DCR issue in prod today. Probably would not have been nearly as easy if I did not have my CLI and base client.  

---

What am I grateful for?

* What are you grateful for?

gf:: I‘m grateful there is a mental health day tomorrow. Because I think I actually need it.  

---

How did I push the needle forward?

pn:: I added a piece to DCR that made it simple to enable/disable steps. I think this will help me with further testing. Need to find more real test cases. Need to get Murtaza using the CLI instead of the jira flow. But I also need to get the jira flow setup as well.
