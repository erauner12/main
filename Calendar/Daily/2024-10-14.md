we can put our helm chart in a repo now in `yul1`

Evan Rauner

separate it from the deployment repo while keeping the values where they are

- [Update Kyverno validation policies to support multiple sources in Argo CD Applications by erauner · Pull Request #162 · Atlas/deployment-policies](https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/deployment-policies/pull/162)


I take it the first PR is encountering errors because the other two have not yet been merged?



Well right now the kyverno yeah but after that I'd get blocked by argocd as well without the deployment-security


larry

but progress

yeah its huge, I'm happy.argocd 2.5.6 -> 2.12.4 in YUL1 is a big jump. a lot of features and stability I think we'll gain from it

still in draft, but I fully expect pushback from CIF, so I'm trying to make sure it's air tight. reasoning why we need it etc (edited)

this would be better if only on the first node, but we decided to let it run on call.

> It currently cannot be changed to only run once as this is what tallies that the DB tables and schemas are in alignment with Express.

> This will run on all nodes but the important one to track or take more time is the HU when it runs on the first node to get deployed on a new release.

> All other no-op deployment or restarts the HU basically would complete in a few seconds.
