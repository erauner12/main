# Saturday - April 27th 2024

In

- [x] Fix markdown re-rendering after making a change
- [x] Make it so any action could bump the memo.
    - $ open

Pinned memos should be able to be sorted amongst regular.

- ? Is that what I want?

```
I don't need all the pinned memos to necessarily be at the top. they can just be visible, and because they have different CSS, I can easily differentiate them. so what I'm saying is, in terms of how the bump works, a non pinned memo can be higher up than a pinned memo and vice versa. this is fine as long as I can easily show/hide pinned memos. does that help you understand what the problem is and what changes are needed?
```

Maintain state when pinned memos are hidden.

- $ I definitely want this.
