Currently on the mac, moving to my NAS for more resiliency.


---


Only problem is that there is that the changes I have pushed do not have their own image, so I need to move the code that has been modified so that an image can be built locally.

Then the image that is built locally can run on the NAS.

…

The more robust option to consider for later would be to setup a docker repository on my Mac Studio so that I could pull from it directly to the NAS.
