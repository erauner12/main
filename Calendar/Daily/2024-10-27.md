[[How to Log in Drafts]]

```
function debugLog(message, data = null) {
  // Create a FileManager instance for iCloud
  let fmCloud = FileManager.createCloud();
  let logFilePath = "/debug_log.txt";

  // Format the message
  let timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  let logMessage = `[${timestamp}] `;

  if (data) {
    try {
      logMessage += `${message}: ${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}`;
    } catch (error) {
      logMessage += `${message}: [Error stringifying data: ${error}]`;
    }
  } else {
    logMessage += message;
  }

  // Get existing log content
  let logContent = "";
  try {
    if (fmCloud.exists(logFilePath)) {
      logContent = fmCloud.readString(logFilePath);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logContent = `[Error reading existing log: ${error}]\n`;
  }

  // Append new message
  logContent += logMessage + "\n";

  // Write back to file
  try {
    let success = fmCloud.writeString(logFilePath, logContent);
    if (!success) {
      debugLog("Failed to write to log file");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    debugLog(`Error writing to log file: ${error}`);
  }
}
```

```
it will be much more simpler than the current task queue that I have I believe:

Readonly
completedTasks
completedTasks: [Task]
Array of completed task lines found in the content, based on active syntax definition for the draft. See Task documentation for usage details.

Readonly
incompleteTasks
incompleteTasks: [Task]
Array of incomplete task lines found in the content, based on active syntax definition for the draft. See Task documentation for usage details.

Readonly
tasks
tasks: [Task]
Array of task lines found in the content, based on active syntax definition for the draft. See Task documentation for usage details. Includes all found tasks, regardless of status.

advanceTask
advanceTask(task): boolean
Update the text representing the task to a next valid state as defined by syntax. If this task has only two states, this is effectively a toggle, if more than two states exist, the next state will be set, including cycling around to the initial state. Note that the task object is not updated to reflect changes made.

Parameters
task: Task
Returns boolean
boolean If true, advance was successful

completeTask
completeTask(task): boolean
Update the text representing the task to a completed state as defined by syntax. Note that the task object is not updated to reflect changes made.

Parameters
task: Task
Returns boolean
boolean If true, completion was successful

resetTask
resetTask(task): boolean
Update the text representing the task to a initial state as defined by syntax. Note that the task object is not updated to reflect changes made.

Parameters
task: Task
Returns boolean
boolean If true, reset was successful

…

I already have started this process but what I’m recongiziing is that for some reason, the draft is not getting updated properly anymore?

can we add some logging around this so we can see what is happening:

ex:

If a drafts checkbox markdown (parent task or subtask) task is empty, it should be processed (a todoist task should be created), then the drafts checkbox should be checked using the methods I described above.

and then when you run the script again, any box that is already checked (parent task or subtask) should be ignored since a todoist task has likely already been created.

example parent and subtask to be able to create:

before:

- [ ] Launch personal blog // next monday 10am p2 d:4h
  - Platform requirements:
  - - Easy maintenance
  - - Good SEO features
  - Content plan:
  - - Weekly articles
  - - Monthly reviews
  - [ ] Setup platform // in 2h d:2h
  - [ ] Install WordPress // in 1h d:1h
  - [ ] Configure plugins // in 1h d:1h
  - [ ] Create content // in 2h d:2h

after: <todoist task gets created>

- [x] Launch personal blog // next monday 10am p2 d:4h
  - Platform requirements:
  - - Easy maintenance
  - - Good SEO features
  - Content plan:
  - - Weekly articles
  - - Monthly reviews
  - [x] Setup platform // in 2h d:2h
  - [x] Install WordPress // in 1h d:1h
  - [x] Configure plugins // in 1h d:1h
  - [x] Create content // in 2h d:2h

We should similarly, still be able to create projects in a similar way:

P[ ] Home Projects // /Active
  - Main container for all home-related projects
  - Includes renovations and maintenance
  - Track active projects

…

once you give me this file, give me some test data and I’ll perform some simple tests and share the logs with you to verify if it is working or not.
