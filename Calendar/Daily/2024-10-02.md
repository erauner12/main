Synchronizer NOde

- Primarily for building and writing the cache
- Can be down once `ready`.
    - You must propagate the cache from it

# MEC Deployment Challenges and Improvements: Integrating Dynamic Components and Streamlining Configuration Management

## Overview

This document summarizes discussions on MEC (Managed Express Cluster) deployment, infrastructure, and configuration management. It covers current challenges, proposed changes, and future considerations for improving the deployment process and architecture. Key topics include Helm chart development, dynamic capabilities, configuration management approaches, and the implementation of new features like dynamic frontends and accelerator nodes.

## Current State and Challenges

1. MEC vs Other Applications
    - MEC is fundamentally different from typical microservices
    - Requires special handling due to complex behavior and operational requirements
    - Needs exemptions from standard Kubernetes practices
2. GitOps and Deployment Approach
    - Current deployment is ad hoc and separate for different components
    - Goal: Integrate various components into a unified deployment
    - Challenge: Balancing between immediate integration and phased approach

## Proposed Changes and Considerations

1. Integration of Dynamic Components
    - Aim to deploy DCR, farmers, synchronizers, and accelerators together
    - Dynamic synchronizer and farmer should be integrated into mainline deployment
2. Deployment Strategy
    - Use Argo CD and applications to manage deployments
    - Keep applications and values in the same place for MEC
    - Need for flexibility in deployment across environments
3. Testing and Rollout
    - Phased approach for testing new components
    - Deploy new versions in specific environments/clusters before wider rollout

## Helm Chart Improvements

1. Progress on helm chart development
    - Getting closer to desired functionality, but not perfect
2. Current limitation
    - Coupling of chart definition and values
3. Potential solution
    - Decoupling chart definition from values location
    - Approach similar to Kustomize

## Technical Aspirations and Challenges

1. Goal: Simplify MEC deployment process
    - Ideal scenario: Use someone who knows how to handle Helm charts
    - Current reality: Not yet at the simplified stage
2. Transition Challenges
    - Need to focus on bridging the gap between current and future models
    - Requires resources and support from all teams

## Dynamic Capabilities and Scaling

1. Dynamic Frontends
    - New feature in 2xPress
    - Enable dynamic scaling of accelerator nodes
2. Accelerator Nodes
    - New feature in 2xPress
    - Challenge: Finding efficient ways to deploy and manage

## Configuration Management

1. Use Cases
    - Disabling protection for a single instance
    - Adding frontend nodes
    - Managing dynamic vs. static configurations
2. Approaches
    - Current: Using static configs, runtime configs, or Ruby scripts
    - Proposed: Flexible approach using inputs from values.yaml
3. Dynamic Nodes Concept
    - Nodes that self-register or deregister
    - Seen as advantageous for easier node management

## Synchronizer Node

1. Purpose and Behavior
    - Primarily for building and writing the cache
    - Can be taken down once ready
    - Investigate running synchronizer node as a job instead of a persistent node
2. Potential Improvements
    - Changing to an init container approach
    - Using S3 for cache retrieval
    - Making cache file belong to a cluster or deployed Express version
3. Technical Considerations
    - Probes and status management
    - Node lifecycle handling
    - Cache management improvements

## Action Items

- [ ] Schedule a meeting between Luis, Venkat, Armand, and Larry to discuss MEC's unique deployment requirements
- [ ] Prioritize integration of dynamic synchronizer and farmer into the main deployment pipeline
- [ ] Develop a strategy for testing new components in isolated environments before full production rollout
- [ ] Create a plan for supporting different versions of operators and charts in various environments
- [ ] Review and potentially adjust the use of Argo CD and application management for MEC deployments
- [ ] Evaluate pros and cons of implementing flexible configuration management approach
- [ ] Investigate impact of dynamic node concept on current infrastructure
- [ ] Develop strategy for maintaining visibility and consistency between config repo and actual cluster setups
- [ ] Investigate running synchronizer node as a job instead of a persistent node
- [ ] Explore implementing cache belonging to cluster/Express version instead of individual nodes
- [ ] Look into using S3 for cache retrieval to simplify the process
- [ ] Update deployment scripts to handle the new synchronizer node lifecycle
