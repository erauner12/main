# Thursday - May 16th 2024

mission with different params if you get rejected or you know nothing like that you would have to implement that yeah i just i'm trying to figure out how to make this like the least confusing uh because like really like how many options do we have like like okay i want to i want to execute a task um if i can't execute it right now i don't want it to start i don't want to queue that thing up i don't i don't want to like i don't want rejected blocked to be set in a way to where if i can't run it now it's going to run it later i want to have control and know exactly when it starts so i want it to be rejected immediately okay so so if that's the case and probably all you need is this field right rejected blocks to be available in the in the morale right so that means that if you say true uh you get rejected and then you say okay i'm gonna submit that later on yeah i think that and then also but if if it's rejected and you know the reason it's rejected is because it's something else is running i think the override block would be useful to say hey i want to force this even though i know something else is running for this client right now yeah okay so these two fields probably yeah right override block and uh and the the last thing when when you when you mentioned that you you know the as we discussed last time the the reason why the scheduler rejected something for submission that doesn't get propagated now to the response so it's it's just locked in a api server output or log uh but probably we could or i could improve that right so that you get the reason why your task can't be scheduled right now i don't know what do you guys uh think similar or what do you think about like how we should make this what do you think i'm not sure right now like i'm this override block and rejected block like i don't know it's kind of scary to tell you the truth because like what if what if somebody wants to bounce nodes right and he he will bounce like four of them together or all of them together all the front ends or all the plus the back end like wouldn't that be i think the issue is more generic right we submitting a a task uh with an on an instance when some other task is running on that already could lead to you know anything depending on which task are we talking about yeah so yeah probably the the override block is really for advanced users who really know what they are doing and you know some specific use cases i can imagine that there there could be maybe but the reject if blocked is nothing against right if you know if you know that you really need to uh run your task now but if you if you can't then you don't want to run it i have a feeling that if we were to not leverage override block at first it would be okay because what's going to be like probably the standard okay what's going to be expected is oh i can't run the task i'm just going to do it how i know to do it manually like that maybe the safest way to introduce this is to to to not use that so that we're less likely to have a problem we're less likely to cause a problem uh they know what they need to do manually they know how to do it they will do it um if they can't do it the way this new way now but but it's but the other one we shouldn't reject it blocked it should reject it um by default like i i just i can't think of many cases where we would want it to be like okay i just tried to execute the task and it can't be executed right now it's gonna queue that thing up it's gonna stay and submit it until it can run i can't think of how many times like well i i can like you can you know you can add a front end or no maybe uh queue up your tasks like when you know what you're doing right you can provision an instance for example and then you you know that after it's provisioned you want to adjust the heap right or you know do something on on that newly provisioned instance so you submit both of the tasks and the the other one will you know will be executed right after the first one completes but you know it's i i'm not saying it's a it's a common way maybe it's it's like really but i can imagine having or let's let's you know not uh discuss that for too much time now what i can imagine having the reject if blocked there on the pop-up window yeah uh just for you know for have that open to have that option like if i can't submit it now i don't want to submit it at all we just need to propagate the reason to back to the user yeah yeah it needs to like be like simple like it needs to it needs to be an easy uh option to because like i actually now that i think about i can i can think so like something often that happens is like all right mirtaza tells l1 hey bounce this node and then bounce that node and then bounce this node and then do that thing it's like that could effectively be queued like each action do that and then this and then do that and then do this and then as long as each action is atomic then you could submit it in such a way that it happens in that order um so i guess that would that could be useful okay hey luke uh you you asked for uh about the

We internally discussed the slack integration and whether or not the tasks should be immediately executed or rejected if they can't be executed at that moment. The two relevant fields are: `rejectIfBlocked`, which immediately rejects a task if it can't be executed, and `overrideBlock`, for advanced users to force task execution even if other tasks are running.

While `overrideBlock` can be useful it can also be harmful, `rejectIfBlocked` should be safer and more straightforward for most users. `rejectIfBlocked` should be the default, with the option to use the override for specific use cases (only advanced users should be able to.)

There's a concern about potential issues if multiple nodes are bounced together. For example with override being used.

We also discussed propagating rejection reasons back in the response.

`rejectIfBlocked` could have some cases where if the task cannot be executed immediately, that it is queued up (in `SUBMITTED` state until it can run)

**JIRA Ticket:**

**Title: Enhance Task Execution Control with `rejectIfBlocked` and `overrideBlock` Parameters**

**Description:**

**Objective:**  
Improve the task execution system to give users more control over task timing and execution, avoiding automatic queuing of tasks and ensuring clear communication of rejection reasons.

**Requirements:**

1. **Implement `rejectIfBlocked` Field:**

    - Purpose: Immediately reject a task if it can't be executed at the moment of submission.
    - Default Behavior: Task is rejected and the user is notified with the reason for rejection.
    - Use Case: Prevents automatic queuing of tasks, ensuring users have control over when tasks are executed.

2. **Implement `overrideBlock` Field:**

    - Purpose: Allow advanced users to force task execution even if other tasks are running.
    - Use Case: For scenarios where users know the implications and need to run tasks despite potential conflicts.

3. **Propagate Rejection Reasons:**
    - Ensure that the reason for task rejection is communicated back to the user clearly.
    - Display this information in the API server output and logs for transparency.

**Discussion Points:**

- The team is concerned about potential issues when multiple nodes are bounced together.
- `overrideBlock` should be used cautiously, primarily by advanced users.
- `rejectIfBlocked` should be the default setting to minimize the risk of unexpected behavior.
- Provide an easy-to-use option in the interface to enable `rejectIfBlocked` without complicating the task submission process.

**Conclusion:**  
The safest approach is to implement `rejectIfBlocked` as the default behavior while offering `overrideBlock` for advanced use cases. Clear communication of rejection reasons is crucial for user understanding and control.

**Tasks:**

1. Develop and test the `rejectIfBlocked` and `overrideBlock` fields.
2. Update the user interface to include these options.
3. Ensure clear propagation of rejection reasons to the user.
4. Document the changes and provide guidelines for advanced users on using `overrideBlock`.
