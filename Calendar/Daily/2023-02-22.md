daily_improve: I think I probably could have better spent the morning just
  trying to give somethinh a shot. I, thankfully, was able to get some
  productivity, and in the afternoon on something that I felt was trivial. But

  "And there's just some aspects of it that are annoying to deal with. I think"
  "I'm going to try and put together a plan to restart my Mac to help with this"
