Certainly, a third JIRA ticket is needed to track the work for updating existing alerts with the required `chart` and `runbook` information. This ticket should be prioritized so that it is completed before the validation pipeline JIRA is implemented to avoid any merge conflicts or pipeline failures. Here's how we could define that ticket:

---


**Acceptance Criteria:**

* The CI/CD pipeline must be updated to include a validation step that checks for the presence of a runbook.
* The pipeline must also validate the presence of a chart link that adheres to the structure provided, with appropriate placeholders for dynamic content.
* If either the runbook or chart is missing, the pipeline should prevent the merge and provide a clear error message to the developer.
* Documentation on how to add runbooks and charts must be provided to guide developers.
* A test case must be created to verify that the pipeline validation works as expected.

To create the labels for the next 15 sprints following the initial sprint labeled "sre-provng-sprint1-06.11.23-18.11.23", we will need to calculate the date ranges for each subsequent sprint. Assuming that each sprint is two weeks long and follows consecutively after the previous sprint, we can generate these dates.

Given the start date of the first sprint is November 6, 2023, and the end date is November 18, 2023, let's calculate the start and end dates for the next 15 sprints.

I'll create a list of sprint labels with the corresponding date ranges for you. Let's start by calculating these dates.

Here are the labels for the next 15 sprints, each spanning approximately two weeks:

1. `sre-provng-sprint1-06.11.23-18.11.23`
2. `sre-provng-sprint2-19.11.23-01.12.23`
3. `sre-provng-sprint3-02.12.23-14.12.23`
4. `sre-provng-sprint4-15.12.23-27.12.23`
5. `sre-provng-sprint5-28.12.23-09.01.24`
6. `sre-provng-sprint6-10.01.24-22.01.24`
7. `sre-provng-sprint7-23.01.24-04.02.24`
8. `sre-provng-sprint8-05.02.24-17.02.24`
9. `sre-provng-sprint9-18.02.24-01.03.24`
10. `sre-provng-sprint10-02.03.24-14.03.24`
11. `sre-provng-sprint11-15.03.24-27.03.24`
12. `sre-provng-sprint12-28.03.24-09.04.24`
13. `sre-provng-sprint13-10.04.24-22.04.24`
14. `sre-provng-sprint14-23.04.24-05.05.24`
15. `sre-provng-sprint15-06.05.24-18.05.24`

These dates take into account consecutive two-week sprints without breaks in between. If there are any specific holidays or non-working days that need to be considered, the dates might need to be adjusted accordingly.
