>> To have these tasks implemented from the Python code perspective. So there's still time but just should be more or less ready. There is also a PR in the API spec, in the SRE API repo to implement the or add these two new tasks to the API and subsequently to the support to the server. So that's this and I pushed the Citrix ingress resource to the API server resources in dev. So we should be good there.

Are you comfortable with us using the api key directly?

Can we just get a credential for ourself.
