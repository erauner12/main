at what age do we start to have better conversations with ourselves

It used to be that physical exercise was a strange thing to pursue

And that smoking cigarettes was normal

It is possible for a whole society to be confused

Next time you feel bad/sad/afraid or even good. How long will you allow yourself to stay locked in the prison of these emotions

You can decide when to Let go of negative emotions. You can get off the ride before you do something stupid that you later regret

When was the last time you read a book for an hour?

People staring into their open palms

You won’t learn how to meditate by doing any of the things you like to do.

But by meditating you will find additional insight into these things

---

Setup automated reminder to reflect via AudioPen at the beginning of and end of the day

---

Build a button to click on Todoist task that creates a tree for the work that needs to happen

---

Side projects that you work on after work should really have their parent task triage time at like 8:00PM

---

Figure out how to change the order of your commits

---

Would be cool if things you want to “try” or things you have “tried” could be pulled out of readwise via tag and put into anybox


Some kind of cron for this

---

Add in reminder to take scoop of protein for lunch and another for dinner/before bed

---

Ask your therapist if social anxiety is something you should work on with her or with a coach?

---

send a message to Larry

let him know @varsamis joining the team (not sure if he is aware). He is a smart python developer, but does not have the knowledge of framework yet.

Ask him if he wants to be apart of the teaching process of new prov-ng api framework. Has come a long way since the sbx migration stuff that we have done

---

Shortcuts should prompt you to set your implementation intention the night before.

Execute a meditation to think about what it is that you set

---

Try thinking about what you need to do the next day while you are brushing your teeth

Even something that might seem silly. I would say that you should do it for things like folding or laundry.

This is called an implementation intention. This goes a step further than writing it down.

Writing it down is great, but he actually have to take those things down and imagine yourself doing them

---

The root of anxiety

Specific traumas or repeated conditioning that you are “not good enough”

Condition you as a kid

Abused or traumatized in some way

There is no direct line

One person might cope with it differently than someone else

Everyone has their own anxious reaction

Emotionally repressed family

Developed Neurotic perception of myself

It’s not sufficient to just discover what the thing is. It is illuminating to solve it. Would help explain it

When you understand what the root is, it offers an explanation.

Every person I get close to ends up blowing up in my face

The only person all of these people have in common with is you

Able to notice irrational thoughts as they arise post therapy

Become more aware or excuses/rationalizations

---

Talk to Eze directly about how you feel about the express operator

This channel is dedicated to disseminating the science about ADHD. It is based on Dr. Barkley's 45 years of clinical practice, research, and teaching and his many books and scientific papers. In 2023, he was named by Research.com as the 37th most influential researcher in the US and 65th in the world in terms of the impact of his research on psychological science as attested to by how often his research is cited by others. He has recently retired. In anticipation of his retirement, he has created videos of more than 30 hours of his lectures that have been posted here for laypeople and professionals alike.  
Although the initial videos posted here are in their original length as given at conferences, most videos have now been broken down into shorter segments, numbered sequentially, and organized into playlists for ease of viewing.

Even if you lose a limb you are still you


The one thing that is constant, is your ability to observe and witness

I think therefore I am

Mec pilot meditation


Imagine you are a pilot

Send a command and your mind will hopefully listen

Notice that the things that you think are you. They are things that you need to interact with

Sit in that place


Window between me and the pain

Distance from yourself from the experience

You'll notice that your life will  
Have fewer regrets
