# Rollover

# Daily Notes


**Pipeline Fails and is Aborted**
- When the process fails, the pipeline is aborted, and the status is updated accordingly.
- JSON representation at failure:
 ```json
 {
   "hasStarted": true,
   "isRunning": false,
   "hasCompleted": false,
   "hasFailed": true,
   "restartCount": [current count],
   "failureReason": [reason for failure],
   "progressPercentage": [progress at failure]
 }
 ```

**Pipeline Resumes After Failure**
- After manual intervention and resolution of the issue, the pipeline is resumed.
- `hasFailed` would be reset to false, and the process would either start again or continue from where it left off.
 ```json
 {
   "hasStarted": true,
   "isRunning": true,
   "hasCompleted": false,
   "hasFailed": false,
   "restartCount": [updated count],
   "failureReason": null,
   "progressPercentage": [progress upon resumption]
 }
 ```

**Pipeline Succeeds After Resumption**
- Once the pipeline completes its task successfully resuming.
 ```json
 {
   "hasStarted": true,
   "isRunning": false,
   "hasCompleted": true,
   "hasFailed": false,
   "restartCount": [final count],
   "failureReason": null,
   "progressPercentage": 100
 }
 ```

We should report the progress of the cache rebuild percentage while we are waiting for the task to progress.

So that we don't need to send it to a slack channel, it will be available right here: [SRE UI | DcrStopFarm - comcast - Task prov-dkinvq4kaw3qqln](https://sre-provisioning-api.eng.medallia.com/ui/task/prov-dkinvq4kaw3qqln)
- in the step states:  


Ex:
```bash
"stepStates": [  
    {  
      "stepName": "dcr_farm",  
      "stepState": "COMPLETED",  
      "stepStateDetail": [],  
      "updatedAt": "2023-11-09T18:22:33.616607Z"  
      "rebuildPercentage": "20.00%"
    },
```


Then the jira client can report that task failed. This way, no one needs to be monitoring rebuild completion percentage from SREBot on a cron or anything like that. We only care when it fails → intervene → retry the task to continue monitoring until completion.

Will be nice to have the progress available from the UI, on the task itself so that you do not need to use `./admin` to get it.

Sergio is going to work on making this available to the `processStatus`

**Begin**
```json
{
  "hasStarted": false,
  "isRunning": false,
  "hasCompleted": false,
  "hasFailed": false,
  "restartCount": 0,
  "failureReason": null,
  "progressPercentage": 0
}
```
- Waiting for DCR to start: `"hasStarted": false`

**Start**
```json
{
  "hasStarted": true,
  "isRunning": false,
  "hasCompleted": false,
  "hasFailed": false,
  "restartCount": 0,
  "failureReason": null,
  "progressPercentage": 0
}
```
- Once DCR has been initiated → `"hasStarted": true,`, waiting for `"isRunning": false`

**Running**  
*DCR now actively running.*
```json
{
  "hasStarted": true,
  "isRunning": true,
  "hasCompleted": false,
  "hasFailed": false,
  "restartCount": 0,
  "failureReason": null,
  "progressPercentage": "[current progress]"
}
```
- Once DCR is running → `isRunning: true`, pipeline will continue to wait until `"hasFailed": true`

**Pipeline Fails and is Aborted**  
*When DCR fails, the pipeline is aborted, and the status is updated accordingly.*
```json
{
  "hasStarted": true,
  "isRunning": false,
  "hasCompleted": false,
  "hasFailed": true,
  "restartCount": "[current count]",
  "failureReason": "[reason for failure]",
  "progressPercentage": "[progress at failure]"
}
```
- `HasFailed` is now true, so the pipeline will fail and look for `failureReason` to provide the workflow with.
- Also capture what the `progressPercentage` was before it failed

**Pipeline Resumes After Failure**  
*After manual intervention and resolution of the issue, the pipeline is resumed. `hasFailed` would be reset to false (because express will auto restart DCR).*
```json
{
  "hasStarted": true,
  "isRunning": true,
  "hasCompleted": false,
  "hasFailed": false,
  "restartCount": "[updated count]",
  "failureReason": null,
  "progressPercentage": "[progress upon resumption]"
}
```
- Upon restarting the pipeline, will use `isRunning` and `hasFailed` to determine whether or not should proceed.


**Pipeline Succeeds After Resumption**  
*Once the pipeline completes DCR after successfully resuming.*
```json
{
  "hasStarted": true,
  "isRunning": false,
  "hasCompleted": true,
  "hasFailed": false,
  "restartCount": "[final count]",
  "failureReason": null,
  "progressPercentage": 100
}
```
- This is what it should look like to determine if DCR has completed.

**Additional Notes**
- Goal is to Abort the pipeline when `"hasFailed": true`
- Most important cue for operators is when `"hasFailed": true`, indicating pipeline failure with a `"failureReason": [reason for failure]`. This allows the JIRA client to report task failure, eliminating the need for constant monitoring of progress.
