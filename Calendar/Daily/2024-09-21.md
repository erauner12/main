# Saturday - September 21st 2024



```
#2a2e30

#355b72

#f4652f

#ff9e7a

#e7f0f4

#ffffff
```

Ex:

The Primary color should be a soft color in the following color palette:

1. The background is now set to `e7f0f4` (soft blue-grey).
2. The border of the phone frame is now `2a2e30`(black).
3. The primary color (used for the border of the phone) is now `#f4652f`
4. The accent color (used for the play/pause button) is `f4652f`  
when needed.
5. The particle cloud color remains `355b72` (blue).
6. The vibrant sphere color is now `#f4652f` (darker orange)

I would like to change how the orb animation and music are triggered.


There just be an additional element below the orb that is like an x axis that a point on a line reaches which triggers the current animation

Upon Refresh we start a timer and the animation begins. This is just for a demonstration, we want an animation that creates a certain threshold and triggers the action. For instance, if we refresh the page, it should start here. It needs to begin around 20 seconds in and play the animation for about 10 seconds. After that, it should pause for another 20 seconds. When it stops, we need the animation to reach a certain point, and I think we're almost there.

For context, we are trying to simulate the following:

Instead of a play button, we will activate the voice when the user reaches a specific threshold during REM sleep (the animation of a crossing some point on x axisbelow). This will send a subliminal message to the user's phone (don't change the current audio it is good right now)

The app is designed to trigger sound during sleep. When the app is open and REM sleep begins, it will activate the voice to deliver this subliminal message.

Since this is currently a demo, we should simulate the process by refreshing the page to start it. I will present this on a slide to help the user visualize what it would look like when reaching REM sleep.

We need an icon in the top middle, something simple like an "H" in the center with circles around it. It is really just a placeholder at this poiint Additionally, we should include a title in a soft font at the top center, labeled "Havitica."



In the actual animation, we need the voice to start a little sooner.. At the beginning, we want the progress bars to start right here and trigger immediately. Does it need to have a progress bar? I think that’s what he was describing.

What we need is a visual representation of the character sleeping, showing where he is in the sleep cycle. This progress should resemble an EEG or a cardiogram—a graph that reveals his status. He wanted it to look like a window displaying a chart of his sleep cycle. REM sleep is the trigger that the sound comes up

It should reveal the information gradually, creating an animation effect. The ripple of the orb in the middle should only start animating as soon as it hits the trigger but should just be still before that.


I'm not sure if that’s the best approach, but we can explore other options.

Let's make a little bit sooner that it actually triggers the sound

Tim. At this . Oint.. So m.. Ybe . Aybe. We like You know, w. have . St. Tic image of it like on the slide a. d once we begin it . O like what . Hat do you thin. Like? Because esse. . Ially essentia. Ly Yeah Hold on just a second it did doit a second ago like right around here Or at least it should have but basically it reached a certain point and then bang it Did the thing instead of a button like by a button Okay, don't don't Don't bother about this part for them. Okay, I just want this thing to When you play a start welcome to habitat the app where you can have it all through the power of your habits Okay, did you tell it what sound to play? Change the sound It's just the one that he put on there. Yeah, so we can put something else in it. Okay. I think it's good It's very good because now I'm gonna put my sink here. This animation is gonna be covered I'm gonna put something else. Oh, yeah, it's just a timing needs to be right like 10 seconds. Yes 30 seconds 10 seconds of Playing then the animation stuff. Okay. Okay. So like your son within about 10 seconds You want it to just immediately like yeah, so but don't don't worry about this right? Yeah, just this is perfect. Oh like I was trying to kind of get the like no that thing that I will make Oh, yeah I but you don't like put it actually in there like in the code. No, I think it's gonna be too hard I think it might actually be my easy to think Here, are you only sharing?

I’d like the animation to behave as follows: it should work gradually. While the voice is talking, the animation should move down. When it reaches the bottom, that’s when the action should occur. It’s challenging to time the animation on campus.
