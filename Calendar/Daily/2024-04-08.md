Leverage configuration value in DCR workfow

We should use what was introduced [in this PR](https://jira.medallia.com/browse/SREPROVNG-401) to ensure that the latest version of the chart is always used at the beginning of the workflow before bringing the pods up.

In the ï»¿`dcr_instance_configure` step, it is recommended to check the existing application version. If the version differs from the one that is in configuration, create a PR to update it before proceeding with bringing up the farmers.

Modification to the argo `Application` file after DCR is run for the first time. But the changes from this PR will always check to see if it needs to be updated.
