There’s more fulfilling relationships out there. You just have to be willing to go through the trial and error of finding them. As much as it is a search for others. It’s also an exploration of yourself. And how you are in your own skin around people [*](https://app.napkin.one/t/NNALSfC4tp44YFh07lbI) #napkin_idea

meditation is the essence of what makes everything else in life worth living  
 [What makes life worth living?](https://dynamic.wakingup.com/moment/MO842D5?share_id=395EDA44&code=SC95E37F0)

I looked at my phone and expected to see that I have not worked out in several days

I was surprised when in fact I did workout yesterday and forgot.

I am getting better at doing the thing anyway, despite how I am feeling




---

I think what is most significant about introducing subtasks and next action automation

Is that I have the ability to queue up by the end of the day what to see if there’s anything left to do if there’s not then I can close it out but if there is then I will add the next thing and schedule it to the next day
