# Daily Notes


Let's have snowflakes for them. Let's keep them on VMs or bare metals and whatnots. But let's have Kubernetes-friendly code on the 90% that don't care about all this, right? I mean, yeah. I want to go back to what you said before about, okay, on one extreme, like the most ideal thing would be to get to is where we have shared services, like let's say five backends and then a whole frontend and that's serving up all. Okay, so if that's not possible and what we're doing right now is not scalable at all, like clearly, then what's the media? What's the compromise? I think we just need to learn how to maybe see somehow better support multi-tenancy and a way that open source tools like CNCF, like certified that they can use. Because multi-tenancy, I'm sure that there's, I mean, I think surely other companies want to avoid this situation as well, but they are at the point where they're like, well, it is the way that it is. So how have they figured out how to support multi-tenancy in a better way? I've been looking at some of this stuff with like Argo CD and like we can use application sets. We can use, we can be plugging these like values in like two instances of applications, but then I'm like asking SIF, hey, can I use this? And they're like, ah, we can't use application sets yet because we've got to do all this other shit. And I'm like, wait, really? Can we not use application sets? Where's the constraint? Where does it lie? Because we need, like, if we're going to, if this is the deployer, we're going to call it the deployer for everything else. It's literally what it's called in the repo, in deployment infra. It's called the deployer, not Argo CD. If this is the deployer, we need to make it fit the needs of not just all these shared services that Medallia has on the side, like that are kind of supplementary to Mac or feeding into it or like dependent on it, relying upon it, whatever. It can't just be the deployer for that. We need it to be the deployer as well for the main product, but it has to support it in a different way, which is inherently not like the way we're doing right now is not multi-tenant friendly. It's not. And so how do we, yeah, how do we. There's a lot of good questions. I think that that's something we'll have to figure out ultimately. You know, I mean, I know how like multi-tenancy works with like Loki. We're not using it that way. Right. But there's like capabilities to do it. I don't know. There's, I mean, there's a lot of interesting things I think we could do, but I think ultimately it's going to take some time to dig ourselves out of this hole ultimately. Right. And again, Vic and I talk about this a lot. It's like, we just entered the cloud arena a little bit too early. In other words, we went to Mesos Aurora, have we waited like another six months or a year? We probably would have gone to Kubernetes. Right. I know. It's just like the worst timing possible. I never thought that you were around for that whole, that whole shenanigans. Right. So, oh man. But I agree. I do think we got to use standards. We can't make things unique for Express because ultimately that means we're building proprietary things, which is not what we want. Right. So. Like we need Helm. We need some, we need Helm and we need Argo CD. We need Argo CD to be doing, to support multi-tenancy. We need to support application sets. We need to be able to, from one file, be able to say, Hey, we want all these. Like, cause you were saying something you mentioned before that I thought of is like, okay. So even though it probably wouldn't be in our best interest to be, to take like, say all of the Express clusters and bump them by a marginal amount, maybe that wouldn't be in our best interest. But even if it wasn't, I feel like we need to be able to do that on a whim anyway. But that requires at this point, like so much operational overhead to be able to accomplish something like that. Even if it did benefit us. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's going to take some time. That's what I'm really getting at is I think that Express is such a monolith, right? That we're not very agile with it. And I get, that's why it's taken, like it took two years for the DCR stuff probably to roll out. Right. But I do hope that we continue to get investments in areas like this to help resolve some of these problems. Right. I just, I worry mostly around following standards, right. Using CNCF products and projects and making sure we're not building our unique, we're not making them more unique. We're undoing, we're undermining the uniqueness, right. Whatever that might look like. We've got to stop it right here. I don't care if we've come 90% of the way and the last 10% will be the entire wheel reinvented. I don't, I don't care. That 10% is not worth pursuing in my opinion. And that might be a rigid thought, but it's just what I believe. It's that 10% is not worth it. We might as well cut our losses right here, start figuring out how to do it, support both until everything's been migrated to the new one. But I think like Larry would disagree with me fundamentally on that. And I've bitched at him about it for a while now. But I don't know. I also, you know, I don't have nearly, like, I think there are probably a lot of blind spots that I have that he, you know, has seen having literally built the type of thing that Argo CD has built a better version of, having attempted it himself, he probably has a better understanding. And that's where I like, I had to take my sword and shield and start lowering it because it's like he is aware of that. So I don't know. Again, I think to bring it up, right. These things are like, because of how tightly the code is coupled, it's not like the infrastructure. He and me, we talk about things because we just know that this is how it's been done for so long. And the code is not going to change very soon. Right. And we need, we have complexities with that complete build. When things become simple is when teams start aligning with what we want to do. And then we can change the infrastructure around that. Right. And again, for that, again, the whole thing is prior prioritization. We don't get that time. We don't get that priority to do these kinds of things, even as a side project. And then, and then build around it and then say, okay, now this is really, this can be done. And this is going to help us in production. Right. That's how things actually develop. Like we talk about things with teams, right. You start building a small POC of that. Once you get the POC and you get buy-in, you can get time and prioritization to get that into production. Don't get that time to kind of build a small POC for this. Talking about stuff does not help. That just gets ideas. The only way these things get done and big companies do is you build a small POC on that. Right. Like this is off that thing. Okay. This is how my, this is how my thoughts are. But we don't have to do it. I push the thoughts to engineering. Engineering gets time to do a POC and say, okay, see, this is how it's going to be looking like. I get buy-in and that's how DCR came about. Right. Yeah. The thing again, for these kinds of things is how do we get that time back to build these POCs from all the discussions that we are having is not going to happen overnight. I get it. It's not. Yeah. Yeah.


---

then he can say, oh, yes, this makes sense. This makes sense. Let's get more people, let's get more money, let's get something done for this, right? Talking on paper doesn't always get that buy-in, right? Like, that's why I think we are a bit behind. It's an uncomfortable discussion to have, I think. It becomes very clear to me once we, like, the Argo Express deployment POC came out, we're like, hey, guys, like, you know, I'm not trying to, like, shit on your parade is the Express operator, but we can do this without it. I'm not saying we should, but the fact of the matter is that we can. So, should we? Like, presenting that option is like, well, it like, I mean, we just need to put everything aside. Like, I don't care who owns what, what is the best decision? And continually revisit that very uncomfortable, like, reality, like, multiple times a month. Like, and like you said, like, actually do something with it instead of complaining about it any further. Like, Complaining is wrong. It's just more like, we have ideas, let's try to build a POC, right? Complaining is fine. We can always crib about stuff. That's good. That's what Dave is also trying to hint at. Is like, if we keep talking about it and pushing it out, people will hear us at some point and build on that or at least take up from there and do something about it rather than not talking about it, right? Like, it's good to have this discussion today. We wasted maybe 38 minutes more than our regular meeting time. It's not wasted. I've enjoyed it. I've enjoyed it. So it's good to keep pushing on these things because you never know when they can happen, but they can happen sooner if you get time to build a POC. Today, if maybe we had extra hours, we wouldn't talk about it. Build a POC, quick POC. Quick means a couple of weeks. Spend on that and show it that say, okay, see, this is how things can be done in a simple, straightforward way. How do we embed this now into the Medallia code base or how Medallia works is a different discussion, but it is doable. Let's think about it now, right? Like, let's get buy-in. Maybe we can, maybe this project goes flat. Doesn't work out. That's fine. But we don't have that liberty today. It's just why we don't have it is because of so many constraints on us from top down. Like the revenue, not getting the resource counts, not getting that money to the resources and things. So everything is adding up, right? And today we are focusing on revenue as a company, right? That's where everything gets chopped out, dropped outside the window is because, oh, we need to focus on revenue. How are we going to support Marriott? How are we going to support Walmart? Throw money at them, right? That's where the whole, what do you call it? The liberty to be creative is getting lost out, right? Creativity. You need to be creative enough to bring in even something that some other company is doing because they were creative enough to build it, but then we need to be creative enough to be able to bring it into Medallia and build our infrastructure around it or a code around it, right? And that's creative. And people have that. I'm not saying no one has it. Just everyone's bottled by so much work and so much support work that they end up doing that they can't get the creative juices flowing to understand what David's trying to bring about or what I'm trying to bring about or whatever it is, right? They listen to it and say, oh, okay. I will think about it in my free time. That free time never happens. Never happens. Yeah, the fact is, is I think the operational overhead for all teams is just too high. So this isOperational overhead, exactly. That's the one. Yeah. So the reality of it, so this is a really interesting discussion. You guys ever read the Google SRE book? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The workbook though. Only the workbook. I haven't read the prior one yet. You gotta read the Google SRE book. I'm not kidding. Like it changed my complete view of like what we're doing in general online. And this is like a couple of years ago. So I know they just made updates to it. Anyways, that's a long story short. But one of the things that the Google SRE book mentioned is like a lot of teams will go into this thinking that functional, all they need to do is write functional code, which is like, you know, hey, functional code, we're done. Throw the SRE ops side, right? The reality of it is it's never that way. It's 50% development, 50% support, right? Et cetera. Non-functional support. So that's things like load testing, instrumentation for metrics, dashboarding, alerting, you know, and all the other things. Like POC is a really good example of this. Do you get like something out of the POC? Yeah, it's possible, but you've gotta spend the time and have the time to actually do the POC. And I think that if you're passive, if you're like, if you look at like an, you know, your little gauge, I guess, and you're too far in operational side of this, you've gotta cut back your toil. So you get back 50% so you can start iterating and start, you know, basically doing the things like POCs, right? And I think that we're just way too far on one end of that. And I think that we're getting better. And I think that Robert has, you know, the mindset of like, we've gotta go and fix a lot of this stuff, which is great, right? But that is the only way, Martaza. And it's just like you said, I totally 100% agree. Like, we've gotta have that time. Our operational overhead is just too much for everybody. And then not just you guys, right? You guys should only be doing the operational overhead is 50% too, right? Because ultimately we want like automation built in ways to do things we don't need to do manually anymore, right? And development teams too, like they're sending out, I know at least the PE side of this, we're spending way more time operational overhead than we are actually doing something like proactive. Yeah. Right, I mean, you can automate so much of the stuff. I mean, it's doable. It's that because you don't have time to even think about it, right? I mean, even your perf analysis or your scale assessment, a lot of it can be automated today, because you have repeatedly the same request, but you don't have resources, you don't have the time and it all boils back to the same thing we just spoke about. So I think it's good. We need to keep having these discussions and hopefully at some point, we get the resources, we get the resource counts and numbers and things like that to all fall into place. And hopefully we are in a state where everyone can then start getting the creative juices going and build POCs and, or at least work and align with other teams to build a POC, right? Like I'm not saying one person has to do it. We can get involved in the free time, right? But at least let's get that freedom. I know Medallia used to have that at some point when we were at the page mill office, the old office, which was very small. We didn't have that many customers on board. There was a lot of alignment with different teams where we could sit down, discuss and build these kinds of things. I've seen that happen at Medallia. But as we went public, as we started growing, we just scaled so fast, sorry, we grew so fast, we didn't scale that fast. We didn't scale correct, right? We lost track there. We, at some point where David is now saying, is we went more towards the operational stuff our gauge is now 90% there, but that will bring it back down because that's where you can get that time. And early because we had fewer customers, the operational overheads weren't that many because it was just five customers that were important. And okay, that's fine. We can support it. We just kept assuming that. Today we have 2000 or that many more customers. We're still doing it the same way. Right? Yeah. Like bounce system and all that. Yeah. Yeah. At some point we will. Yeah. And the way that this works best, frankly, and I'm not trying to get too deep into the weeds to solve this now, but really if we had SLAs to build the SLOs to be able to really tell us how we're actually working. Right? I can tell you right now from the OE side, it's like last week, last week we could tell.


---


that look like counting how many alerts we got to unplanned GC. How many times did that exact thing happen over the course of this last month and where was it happening the most? Like that, you mean? Or is itYeah, so we don't have SLOs exactly, which is really where I wanna get at. That's the key indicator that we should be looking at across all services, frankly, right? But what we can see is user's experience is not optimal. Like they're actually seeing impact in certain areas. Like either we get reports that like, hey, we got an alert from SYD1. We have a problem with SYD1 right now, by the way. Right, and so SYD1 alerted the team and like, that's not good. Like, we don't want that. We also can see user's query performance. Like their performance, actually the queries is not great. And then when we go and investigate that, we're like, oh, oh, we have this networking problem there. Or the way our architecture is, it's not great right here. We need to look at other options. So all this has actually caused us to review, like the actual architecture that we're going toward. And there's gonna be some pretty big changes in our architectures coming to metric side, just so you guys are aware. I'm not gonna go into the details now, but like we wanna actually simplify the architecture as a whole. Like rather than having Prometheus shards like living within a cluster, we actually wanna run one daemon set that has all observability tools built into the one daemon set. And that one daemon set will be local in the node. So let's say, you know, you have, first of all, that will scale for us because now we can just capture everything that's on that one node. You know what I'm saying? So that's just, it's just to having us review. But if you don't take a pause and say sometimes, say, hey guys, I know we wanna build X, which has never been the case at Medallia. We've always said we're gonna build X regardless of whatever else happens, right? Sometimes you have to say, we need a pause and not build X right now. We need to turn around and revisit what is not working well. And then what I'm really saying is sometimes that pause is necessary, right? But having that key indicator, like you're saying, is really the holy grail to be able to know, do you need to pause or not? And that really is SLOs. And that's the actual Google SRE book talks about this. Yeah, I think I'm gonna read on that more and ask you some questions if I do. Yeah, yeah. So again, we're not perfect too because we need to build out our own SLOs. That's something that we're thinking about heavily right now because once you have SLOs, you can start doing what they call error budgeting. Like when you start having too many error, you know, too many errors in production services, do you take a pause and go fix those from all other planned work? Ultimately, you do unplanned work to solve that. So you twirl back and your gauge gets right back in the middle again, right? Does that make sense? Yeah, I think it does. Yeah, I remember the last company, we used New Relic and they were essentially, when we started using it, training us on how that worked. And, but it was their way of doing it, but it doesn't need to be any specific type of ATM. If you have something, it's better than what we're doing right now, right? Yeah. Yeah, that Google SRE book really did change kind of my mindset and how to look at running online services in general and really some best practices, frankly, right? And I get it, it's a Google bias, right? And you kind of have to take that with an aspect, but the ideas are sound, if that makes sense. Yeah. It's just about how to instrument those ideas


---

each other to improve on that and that's what we're discussing like how can SREs work together, how can PerfEng, Observability Engineering, how can RDP, how Cocoa, everyone can work together and make this better. It's not going to be one person's job or one team's job. It is all of MCS, all of Medallia that has to be able to do this and that starts from the contracts that we sign or how we sign these SLAs and things like that right. So all that and this is very good to have so don't worry. I truly appreciate that feedback because I think I am guilty of that and I'll try to work on less crying more. I don't think you cry. I said I'm very honest about it like at least whatever discussion we have I never feel that. I mean maybe we go on and on about certain things which that's just a different way. That's just the developer working and a production services SRE person kind of discussion right. That's where maybe we have our differences but that's fine. It's always good to have differences. You can't have two people always align or always be in agreement because that's just bad, what do you call it, camaraderie in the team. There will always be something right. Like you have to be different to be able to speak out and then we can come to a conclusion on what do we want to do because the business wants that. It's not like who's right or who's wrong. Everyone. I actually think the diversity is really important right because you bring in different perspectives on that side right and so I think that having your perspective Evan what you think you've done is actually really useful. I think that what's most important though from all of us is making sure the strategy that we're attacking is what is solid right because tactically we could go and attack it at different ways and all of us are going to have our own way to attack it and frankly all of them will probably be okay. There might be some that might be superstar way to approach it right but if it's strategically aligned with what we want to get at where we want to be that's what's super critical. That's why we're talking like CNCF and that's why we're talking about getting expressed in a way that can manage in the fabric like those are strategic things that we need to attack right and so I think that having those discussions is really important right make sure that we're aligned on the strategy for in general what direction we're going right and I get your perspective about just being really frustrated tactically like why are we doing it this way or you know or whatnot but just don't forget like all of us are going to have our own strategy you know our own tactical way to handle things and I think that that's still important to to make sure we align on that but ultimately is it going in the direction that Medallia really needs strategically yeah right north star you have to look at the north star yeah yeah look at the north star yeah that's funny when yeah when Joe talks about north story he's talking about the strategy making sure we're all going in the right direction right and I'm gonna be I'm gonna be a little more blunt here and maybe you guys feel differently but I feel like I like Mike O and Mike O did a really good job when he came into Medallia initially even though after like IPO I feel like he kind of just fell off the earth for a while and didn't really provide strategy I think that bit us right because we kind of fluttered for a little while they're trying to figure out what what direction which would be going what is the technical strategy that we have right I don't know but I just you know I think that Robert does have strategy and I do feel like he's getting things aligned in a way that we're going to be successful but it's going to take some time right to get that strategy I'm like then you just said David I might I might not agree completely 100% on what you just said but maybe I can steal that because top what what is what bottled into Mike O's decision making was probably what the CEO and what the board it's true so maybe maybe now we align different because now we are no more a public company that allow some of this to come back the creativeness the alignments to change the focus to change maybe that's where he kind of got lost yes that's true maybe it's a different different way of looking at things right maybe just putting the blame somewhere else maybe even then you could have still said that no we want to strategize ourselves to be like heading towards the direction and not losing losing that alignment maybe he could have maybe he didn't have the power I don't know we weren't in the


---


that already exist, right? There are CNCF projects, right? So I think that as long as we're all going the same direction, and there's not like somebody saying, hey, I'm gonna go build this one thing off. Here, you're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you know, let's revisit. Like, let's just take a quick peek and see if there's something out there, right? And so I think that's really what ultimately I was getting at in that is, I think it's just really important. That's the kind of thing I think where I'm way more vocal than I probably should be, is if I feel like we're going the wrong direction in a certain area, because I'm like, we wanna strategically be going all in the right direction, right? And whatever that might look like, tactically, obviously, we already talked about that, but I'm just saying, strategically, we wanna be heading there, right? So I think that's when it's important to be vocal about, right? Just going in the right direction. So be vocal. I think that's good, right? Yeah, yeah. All right, guys, we're way over. I know that we spent way more time, but I think it was a good discussion. I really appreciated this discussion. I'm glad to actually hear that some of the things that the platform team's looking at, too, and Express Sites, I think it will help, hopefully, abstract Express from being so proprietary. Yeah. Right? And I'm looking forward to that, frankly. I think that will help us long-term. I'm just gonna keep working DCR and work through the frustration. I'm learning a lot in the process, you know? It's good. That's all you can do. Honestly, you're gonna have good and bad days, right? But at the end of the day, hopefully, you're getting some stuff done that you fulfilled that way. That's what's really important, right? Yeah, yeah. So, all right, guys. Thank you, guys. Thank you. All right, thank you. All right, take care. Have a great weekend. Later. Bye. Bye. Bye.

The issue encountered was during the execution of the `DigitalProvisionAccount` fix_units step. An error occurred while running a groovy script. The script failed because it contained a string with a single quote character (`'`), specifically the string `Stock'n Business`. In the groovy template, strings were enclosed in single quotes, which led to a syntax error when processing this particular string.

The error message indicated a `MultipleCompilationErrorsException` due to an unexpected character, caused by the single quote in the string `Stock'n Business`.

The solution to this problem is straightforward: replacing the single quotes (`'`) with double quotes (`"`) around string values in the script.
