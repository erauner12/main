# Prod Deployer Web App: Benefits and Downsides

## Potential Benefits

- More robust than the current CLI approach
- Easier to interface with programmatically
- Provides a centralized system for managing deployments
- Offers more detailed control and visibility into the deployment process
- Can recover from container restarts
- Allows for flexible targeting of deployments using selectors

## Potential Downsides

Data Centralization:
- Storing everything in a properitary database could make it less accessible to other tools and processes

Complexity
- Introduces a new system that needs to be maintained and understood
- May require additional training for team members

Dependency on New Infrastructure:
- Requires setting up and maintaining new infrastructure (database, web service)
- Potential for increased operational overhead

Integration Challenges:
- Might not align with the eventual goal of managing MEC as statefulsets with ArgoCD

Version Control:
- While possible in a database, version control might be less intuitive than it is with git
- Could make it harder to track changes over time compared to Git-based workflows

Debugging and Troubleshooting:
- Might be more challenging to debug issues compared to the current CLI-based approach

Lock-in:
- Could create dependency on this custom solution, making future transitions to other tools or approaches more difficult

Migration Effort
- Moving from the current system to this new approach could be time consuming
