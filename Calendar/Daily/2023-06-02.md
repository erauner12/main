> Rescuing a Stray: Campus Dog Finds Shelter
>
> Haley brought a dog to my place today, which she found on the university campus near her home. The dog is quite friendly, and I'm happy to provide shelter for him temporarily. It's also great that Lucy, my own pet, gets along well with this older dog without any aggression or issues. Overall, I'm grateful Haley found him and could bring him here for safety.

Anybox should be used as a place to insert tasks that you want to take out of todoist

This is of course, if you do not go ahead and just delete it

Get cli to spit out parameters and logs every time a task is started

Would be nice to have the execution string as well for local execution
