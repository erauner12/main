## Journal

Was today a good day?

howwasday:: it was not bad. I think I accomplished a lot. Was able to switch contexts and iterate on multiple things that were important

What excited me?

Answer:

exciteme:: the changes I made to Todoist again. I have some pretty complex logic setup now which I think will help reduce the strain involved in choosing when to do something. So I can focus more so on just doing what I said I was going to do.

---

What drained me of energy?

drainenergy:: wasting more time than I needed to trying to get mec add frontends working.

---

What have I learned?

---

What am I grateful for?

- ? What are you grateful for?

# Daily Notes

How getting every rep done on your exercise feels the same as getting your tasks done at the end of the day

---

Look at skillshare courses. 30 day trial started June 1

<https://www.skillshare.com/en/home>

---

I am glad that I spent the extra time working on dcr responding to mhalva comments.

I spent a better part of the day procrastinating it. But what got me to start working on it was thinking about how he out the effort in to create all those comments for me

---

It was pretty awesome to see the drafts iCloud syncing finally working correctly on my computer
