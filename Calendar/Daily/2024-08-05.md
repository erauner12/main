# Monday - August 5th 2024

I am running into an issue, I think it is related to the most recent change to the system I have introduced which is the serializer.

I'm not sure when this broke but basically no matter what, even if

```
DEBUG:core.step_executor:Starting execution of step init
```

```
INFO:lib.abstract_step:starting step 'StepInit' for platform: 'mec', task: 'MecBounceNode' with vars: BounceNodeVars(_initialized=False, _completed=False,_ task_unique_id='GBEULGZ8', region=None, country_id=None, dc=N
```
