# Friday - June 21st 2024

I would say, hey, Larry, you need to cooperate. You need to cooperate with the rest of the teams, not trying to build a silo or continue with a silo that you've been building here for 10 years or even more. And cooperate in a sense that it's the right time now to choose the way forward and we need to work together on that. Probably this is the one thing that I would tell him. It seems to me that he hasn't been cooperating with other teams that much. Or maybe just give it another chance. Because Kubernetes is not the same thing that it used to be 10 years ago. And so on. There are ways to accomplish all these things. Yeah, I mean, exactly. Cooperate in a sense that here is the approach that we would like to go with, like having Helm charts, Kubernetes, Argo CD, Express operators, things like that. And let's build the solution together. You have the expertise. Probably you're the one that's having the expertise probably, you know, in all medallia regarding the deployments. And we need your insight. Do not try to invest in ProDeployer anymore. Like go and invest into this in this team effort. And let's build that, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anytime he comes at me with the specifics, that's when I'm going to try to divert to something because talking about the specifics, it's just not productive. Especially just between the two of us. You know what I mean? You can tell him always if he goes too deep and he's trying to corner you. And I'm not meaning that it's like a fight or whatever. But I mean, you can tell him, okay, maybe you will not have an answer to what he's saying. You can tell him, okay, I don't have an answer right now, but I will make a note, discuss with my team and next time we can meet with my team and we can give you an answer how we're going to do this X or Z and so on. Maybe it's even more simple that maybe he's just afraid that he's going to lose this chance to work on something like deployments. You know, if we deprecate ProDeployer, maybe he's just afraid of that. So maybe you should tell him that we need you. We want you to help. Yeah, exactly. We need you to help us because we were not able to do that without you or whatever. Yeah, I mean, it's not true, but it is true to some extent. What we need him for realistically is to help us understand why things are the way that they are. Because he knows, it's all in his head, like why, you know, we're deploying ig slug and this weird ass configure, like that's the shit I need to know. Like, but the other things like deployments and I think that that's something that we could develop our own take on. But yeah, like I think the perspective that is like… To me, I think that ideally, really, Larry should be the one implementing the Express Operator. All this, you know, actions that need to be implemented there. Since he has, you know, since he has the knowledge of how things should work, he should be implementing that, right? Unfortunately, he's a Java guy. We need someone who's, you know, more flexible in Golang, you know, since it's Go, but… The only person working on the Operator is Sif's intern. Yeah. Which… Who's that? Annie, which again, I'm not even… She's an intern. Yeah, I'm not even complaining because she has been so constructive and helpful about everything. Like, I can't even be mad. Like, that's… You know, but that's, that's, that's, you know, the…

Hey Larry,

We need your cooperation with the rest of the teams to move forward effectively. Building and maintaining silos isn't beneficial, especially given the advancements in Kubernetes over the past decade. It's crucial that we adopt modern tools like Helm charts, Kubernetes, Argo CD, and the express operators.

Your expertise in express and deployments is invaluable, and we need your insight to build a better solution. Let's shift our focus away from ProDeployer and invest in this team effort.

If specific technical details arise, we can discuss them with the team for comprehensive solutions. Your knowledge about our current express deployment configurations is critical, and your involvement in implementing the Express Operator would be highly beneficial.

We want to assure you that your role is vital in this transition, and your contributions are necessary for our success.

- Cooperation with the rest of the teams is essential for progress.
- Avoid building or maintaining silos.
    - Everyone is trying to solve the solution all on their own.
- Adopt modern tools like Helm charts, Kubernetes, Argo CD, and Express operators.
- Your expertise in deployments is invaluable.
- Focus on team efforts instead of ProDeployer.
- Discuss specific technical details with the team for comprehensive solutions.
- Your knowledge about current deployment configurations is critical.
- Your involvement in implementing the Express Operator is highly beneficial.
- Your role is vital and your contributions are necessary for our success.

- **Cooperation**: Avoid building or maintaining silos.
- **Modern Tools**: Adopt Helm charts, Kubernetes, Argo CD, and Express operators.
- **Expertise**: Your knowledge in deployments is invaluable for this transition.
- **Team Effort**: Focus on team efforts instead of ProDeployer.
- **Specifics**: Discuss technical details with the team for comprehensive solutions.
- **Current Knowledge**: Your understanding of current deployment configurations is critical.
- **Express Operator**: Your involvement in implementing the Express Operator is crucial.
- **Vital Role**: Your role and contributions are necessary for our success.
- **Long-Term Vision**: Leveraging modern tools over proprietary solutions will lead to long-term savings.
- **Cohesive Work**: Let's ensure that our efforts are unified and not isolated.
- **Expert Guidance**: We need your insight to help us transition smoothly and make informed decisions.

Let’s build the solution together using the best tools available and leverage your expertise for a successful transition.

---

- **CRDs and Operators**: CRDs and operators are appropriate for applications with complex startup, shutdown, or reset logic.
- **Group Deployments**: There is a need for a tool to manage group deployments, which can also be handled with external tools.
- **Standard Practices**: Single deployments should follow standard GitOps practices.
- **Automation**: Complex operations like rebuilding caches and adjusting heap should be handled by automation.
- **Division of Responsibilities**: Each team should focus on specific functions (e.g., provisioning, deployments, maintenance) rather than solving all problems individually.
    - **Provisioning**: Handled by automation.
    - **Deployments**: Managed using Helm charts and GitOps.
    - **Group Deployments**: Managed by deployment automation.
    - **Maintenance Operational Tasks**: Handled by relevant automation tools.
    - **Complex Startup/Shutdown/Reset**: Managed by operators.
- **Avoiding Silos**: Ensure responsibilities are appropriately divided without creating silos.
- **Unified Approach**: Support a unified approach to manage deployments and push back on attempts to centralize all functions within the operator.

By following these principles, we can effectively utilize modern tools and streamline our processes while leveraging your expertise and maintaining clarity in roles and responsibilities.

# Corrected Explanation of `add_or_modify_files` and PR Creation Behavior

## Actual Behavior

Based on the implementation of `github_add_modify` and `get_or_create_pr`, the correct behavior is:

1. Changes are always made to a branch.
2. PR creation is controlled by the `create_pr` parameter.
3. When `create_pr` is True:
    - If a PR doesn't exist, it creates one.
    - If a PR exists, it uses the existing one.
4. The `automerge` parameter determines whether to merge the PR immediately or not.

## Key Points

1. We never make changes without creating a PR when `create_pr` is True.
2. When `create_pr` is False, changes are made to the branch, but no PR is created or merged.
3. The `get_or_create_pr` function is only called when `create_pr` is True.

## Corrected Understanding

- When `create_pr` is True:
    - Create a PR and merge it immediately if `automerge` is True.
    - Create a PR without merging it if `automerge` is False.
- When `create_pr` is False:
    - Make changes to the branch without creating a PR.

## Implications for `add_or_modify_files`

The `add_or_modify_files` function should ensure that:

---


- Changes are always made to the branch, regardless of `create_pr`.
- PR creation and merging logic is only executed when `create_pr` is True.
- When `pulls` is empty and `create_pr` is True, it should proceed with creating a new PR.
- When `pulls` is not empty and `create_pr` is True, it should use the existing PR.



…


So I'm trying to understand something:We never make changes directly to a branch without first creating a PR We either create a PR and merge it, or create a PR and choose not to merge it yet? Right?So this should be the behavior of `add_or_modify_files` ?

- Changes are always made to the branch, regardless of `create_pr`.
- PR creation and merging logic is only executed when `create_pr` is True.
- When `pulls` is empty and `create_pr` is True, it should proceed with creating a new PR with the changes
- When `pulls` is not empty and `create_pr` is True, it should use the existing PR.
