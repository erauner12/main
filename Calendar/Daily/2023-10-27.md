Goals with a grant


or product offering as a business, or it has to build yourself up as a researcher in a space. And so that's the alignment problem, typically. You propose research, and if you're not the right person to do it, or you don't have the right team, in other words, it's not going to help your product or your research progress, then they'll fail you. Additionally, they have goals with the grant. Like, you know, we want to fund projects that will enable electronic vehicles to drive confidently. So you have to pitch your research to say, hey, we're going to do this, because this is essential into making that thing happen. And so here's what it is, and why it's going to work, and how it'll help us get to the ED self-backing, or whatever, right? So that's phase one. After phase one, if everything goes well in your research, most of them have a phase two, and phase two is different depending on the branch of government you're in. For the DOD, you're looking at, phase one, you did the research to figure out how to target submarines underwater, or whatever. Phase two is, can you build a prototype? And so you have to do the same thing, application. Here's what we're going to build, why it's going to work, how it's going to get some research we have, and our plan of action, and they'll fund that, and that's, phase two is typically the big one. You know, two million, three million. Et cetera. And then you have phase three, which is not government-funded, but they take about 25% of the people who've made it through phase two, to give the approval of like, hey, we will buy this from you, if you ask me to do so. But you're on your own for that, right? So you said phase three is non-government? The phase three is, you have to go elsewhere to figure out how you're going to mass-produce it, but the government will buy it. Okay. And so for researchers, phase two, and really, phase two and beyond, look like, hey, we like the research that you did, do you have another idea of how you could continue further with the research? And that's what the grant is for, is just to justify for more time spent on the thing? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think so. I think so, this is great. This is great.


---


How is each grant, like, do they have any constraints on the first one, and the second, and the third? Like, what parameters, I guess, do all have in common and whatnot? Yeah. Shorter answer is it's all different depending on the grant requirements. Requirements will say different things, and they give you a 30-page PDF to look through, which has all the requirements, including… Okay, everyone, workshop's starting in five minutes, or like four minutes now. Okay, sure. Including, like, you know, what font size, and, you know, how many pages, and what are your sections, and, you know… Can you write those down? Yep. Oh, sorry. So, correct me if I'm wrong.

SBIR
* Small businesss information research



Who is buying
* Defense contractors
* Startups
* Researchers




Phase 1 → Research Paper

Phase 2 → Research or Prototype

Phase 3 → "We will buy if you manufacture"




Requirements (inputs):

Formatting

Sections

Length
* How long you should be funded for

Budget

Personell req


Acceptance rate problem


Why you get rejected most of the time
* Not the right team, to be doing the prototyping
* Idea is not novel enough
	* Lack of citations
* Misalignment with grant goals



Startups, or like under employees, and then we're looking at researchers. Is there any PhD people at universities? Like Rachel, who I was describing to you out there, she has one of those. And so these are the main three people that are applying for these. And so grant cycles, you have a phase one, which is a research paper. And then you have phase two, which is either research or prototype. And then for research, you continue to have your phases as long as you find them. And then for prototypes, you'll have real-life if you manufacture. Let's see, so requirements for grants. And I'm just talking about the problem here. You have formatting, sections, length of your grant, like this is how long it should be funded for. Oh, and you need a budget. Budget funds. So everything we do with solving this acceptance rate problem should be focused on the three things that I've found are the reasons why people get rejected most of the time. Three things being not the right team to be doing the research prototyping. Your idea is not novel enough. And this could include, you said you were doing this research, but you didn't. I'm reviewing it, and I'm a professional researcher in this field, and you didn't cite my paper. Or lack of citations. And then the third one is misalignment with grant goals. So everything we focus on in the software solution solves one of these three problems. So what I wanted to show you here, and did you manage to message me? So you sent it to me.

Hayley:
> I think a friction point for some people would be stating the need and benefits that the grant would provide clearly toward the beginning and restating at the end after an argument is made, because that’s how you can make a strong case for whatever you’re asking for.


---



people investigate TORs, and these people have to be like master's degrees or PhDs that have experience in the field, right? It's very much the more you've done, the more likely you are to get funded to do more, right? And so what people do is, if they don't have all the people on their team that says this team is full of like really qualified individuals that have done this kind of stuff before and in the past, and there's no doubt that they can actually pull this off, then this isn't a problem. But most of the time, this is a problem because I don't know, maybe as a startup, or I don't know what I don't know, right? And additionally, I don't even know where to go to get the right people on my team, right? Researchers, how they do it is they try and stay within their own bubble, and if they need to collaborate, they've been networking in their departments forever, and so they just grab a friend, and then they put both of them on the grant, and they do it. Researchers typically put undergrads on the grant as well, as non-key members, just to say, hey, we're going to have someone do the groundwork, right? And startups and defense contractors do the same thing, but it's not undergrads, it's people that are paid less. And so that's what we mean by not the right team. And so I talked to a panelist, and this is the one people I interviewed, he said that what he typically does is he looks at the team, he reads the summary on them, and then he'll actually go and see if any of the papers they cited are co-authored by one of the people on the team.

---


Where do I find them? Okay. Sounds very political. Yeah. So, you said that one of these three problems is what we should tackle, right, or are you saying that … There's no way we can do all this tonight. Yeah. And so, misalignment with grant goals, that's the MVP that I've already built, and I want to show you. Gotcha. Okay. Cool, cool. So, what I want to do next is either not novel enough or some kind of interface to where I can start gathering data so I can then solve one of these problems, if that makes sense. And an additional thing we could do is just continue to lean into this last point and expand the functionality from just SBIR to government grants or whatever. And so, look at this here. So, you'll click a link. Oh. All right. So, you get this right here.


---


Realizing that they have the problem to coming to our service to use it, the process of using our service, and their end results, where they'll hopefully come out happier. Yeah. The purpose of this is just basically to solidify that path for our development. Yeah. That's really good. So, if we're looking at this, who makes the decision that, hey, we need to go get a grant? It's the business owner, right? It's the start-up founder. Okay. So, business owner. What about the sales?



---

Find something that even if somebody is just starting off their journey to get a grant or knows what grants is and just wants to add this tool to their tool belt, they can use it without being annoyed either way because it permits, I don't know, it permits your level of scale it will adjust to because there could be a variety of ways we could do that. Just basically ask at the beginning, what's your experience with grants?


---


There's grant cycles for every single department, and they have a whole table to show you when they are, but typically grants are open for one to three months, maybe twice out of the year per department. Some departments have longer time frames, short time frames, more grants less. Okay, so I guess I'm just trying to think of a like flow here. So at a certain point, like X amount of days before it begins, let's say 60 days out before the starting point, we email this list of previously rejected companies, and then the previously rejected companies, let's say however many of them do respond, and then we start the new customer. Well, I guess, would that be where it starts there? That would be people, well, maybe


---


Yeah, I get it. Yeah. A few little fails on there, too. Yes. Because the messaging is quite simple to draw them in. Like, have you previously been rejected for a business grant? We'll get you funded for an SBIR loan, or you don't pay. And from there, so that, to me, so that's grabbing. We've got the customer. That's the discovery part about how they find us. The education part, that's as simple to me is like a very strong landing page, where, like earlier, we learned in the creative process, we learned about using this software called, like, was it Synthesia? Or whatnot, that would basically have AI, basically kind of AI-generated video, basically talk to you very briefly. And in case anyone watched that video, it's like we're just highlighting some really strong points underneath there to get them, really just kind of like to get them to win, or whatever. And then what I want that video and the copy to kind of do is, like, basically explain from there whether or not they would be someone that would best qualify to even go any further from that point. Because after that, I think that's when we would get to the use part, right? Where it says, let's see, does the customer use your product? Yeah, because if they don't qualify, they should know that right there in there before they even bother using that. Right, before you even bother, like, using that form. So I, yeah.

---


It's not comprehensive, it's just which approach I want to fail to learn. And that's not public knowledge? No. So then my…


---


* There are two ways to monetize: paying if we win, and offering grant discovery for an upfront fee
* What motivates them to buy is the acceptance rate, not paying anything upfront, and the idea that it will be simple
* Don't mention AI until they are on the phone, as it might scare them off
* Sell them on the idea that AI will make this easy

There's kind of a couple of ways I think we can monetize. One is, you know, you pay if we win. Another one is, you know, different features with, you know, we'll do the grant discovery for you for an upfront fee, and then if you want us to help you write it, right. So what motivates them to buy your sign-up? So, I always say it's the acceptance rate. Right, so the acceptance rate, so three things. So the acceptance rate, not paying up anything upfront, and then selling them on the idea that this is going to be very simple, right. So the stuff that you're talking about, I wouldn't tell them anything about that until they've gotten on the phone, you know, or something like that. Because if they start, you're gonna go, probably gonna click off, and that's not what we want. We want them, we want to sell them off back and look like, hey, it's gonna be easy as, easy as cake. And AI, which you've heard everything about, but you know nothing about, is gonna take care of this for you. So, so what you mean is?

---


Can help you get this grant, security grant. I was thinking if we want to bring in some inspiration from TurboTax, they visually separate things to show that they're separate. We can use visual cues along with just simply telling them and have like a TurboTax Intuit mindset when coming along to it. TurboTax is doing the same thing. Taxes are hard. We make it easy. We save the time. No upfront fees.


---


and automate grant discovery for them, maybe I can charge a fee for that, right? I can help them step through the grant process, maybe we can submit it for them, or maybe we write it for them, or maybe we say you can use our software if you give us X percent, some kind of tiered approach. Okay. What about subscription, have you thought about that? Yeah, I have, and I'm not sure that would go well with a subscription, with fatigue. Yeah, even when I think about resumes. Are there chaps on grant, like grant writing, or grant applications? Like how many you can send out? Yeah, and so Harvard, for example, they submit tons and tons of grants, but it's a law, you can only get one grant from each agency, and so they have people dedicated that's their full-time job to reject grants. And so they get a bunch of accepted, and then they choose the most profitable one by agency, and then they reject the rest, right? That's why it's 90% that goes unclaimed, because there's so hard, there's red tape around it. Big businesses, I mean, Harvard gets 46 billion a year, and I'm like, what? And now, trust, yeah, that's the last thing that we need to do.

---

is that we could have the three phases, or not even the three phases, but like bigger blocks that they have to do on the side. And then the individual steps are up top. I'll draw it later. The user interface is what I'm thinking of. OK, yeah, yeah, OK. Yeah? So the form takes the information and then puts it into the portal, right? Is that what we're saying, is pulling it into the portal? And then from there, we create this step one, step two, step three process for them to complete it, and we assist them along the way? Is that it? The form will pull it to the database. And I have all of that information in my database. We can put it wherever we want. Right now, I just have a trigger that says, compile it to an email and send it off. But we could easily put that into a dashboard. And then send them the link to get into that. And we would have to authenticate them somehow into that. Yeah, I mean, so you're probably, let's see. Yeah, you'd have to, there's some email authentication magic involved. I guess right now, I'm thinking about how to keep the user on track in this process, right? Well, it's the flow of the app, the flow of the questionnaire. So the flow of the app.

---


the grants, right? And they're like, OK, I'm reading through these, and I think I've decided that I want to apply for this one. How do we get that information and get it into the same platform so that they're following the steps they need for exactly that type of grant that they've chosen? Yeah. And a lot of that is National Likers Processing, which I'm an expert in. And so a lot of the information you saw on the email there, that's not anywhere in the database. It's just in the 30-page long thing when I'm able to extract it. And so by doing similar things, I can extract this section for the requirements for that section, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And so in my mind, maybe they have this dashboard, and we're in the grant discovery phase. And they say, oh, that one looks like a good match. I want to apply for it. So let's do the next page, where we have some kind of like, here's your requirements checklist. We're going to walk you through it. Start with the technical summary. Describe what you want to research. We'll help you through it. And then from there, we'll pre-generate the rest of the sections as we can and help you identify weak spots as you're walking through it. So then I'm wondering if there's a way where.


---


Okay, so first thing that happens is they hit our homepage, right, and then we've got this catchy headline, we have an AI video, right, and then the sub-headline, and then like those, I guess those three things that we want them to like really pay attention to. You guys got about five minutes. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Or maybe it's not three things. It probably ends up being like three easy steps, right, because that's what people really want to see. Underneath there is just like some testimonials of other people who have worked with us, and then that strong CTA for them to complete that form, right? So when they get to the second page, that's when they're going to do the form. The third page is going to be their confirmation page for that form. It's going to give them a brief explanation of their next steps, which are that they need to check their email for their account confirmation, right? And if they didn't receive an email, they need to make sure they reach out to us via email because some people put in the wrong email address. So from there, they will check their email. If it should give them their account like username and login details or whatnot, and then, of course, they're going to email us. From there, from that link, it is going to take them to their grant review page. That grant review page, on each one, it's going to take them through each grant. So maybe the first page is like grant one, and then there's a window here with their PDF explaining what that grant is. Underneath here, you have buttons for them to decide after reviewing. Do they want to decline this and not apply for it, or do they actually want to accept it? Do they want to add it to their queue? So there will be multiple of these. Once the final one is done, that's going to take them to their dashboard, right? And so here on the left side, you have all their grants. So grant one, grant two, grant three, and so forth. Below here, you're going to have each one of the steps that is going to be needed according to what was required for them to fill it out. Not only are there steps, but there will be markers or buttons or circles or whatever that will highlight whether or not that spot has actually been completed or not, so they know where they are in each step of the process. Let's say that they're in step one. It's going to give them a brief explanation of what is needed, maybe like a tip or a prompt. And this is the input section, and AI will help them generate, for the most part, what is needed for that section, right? Up here, we have our undo button. We also have a save button, also an option to whether or not they want this to auto-save or not. I feel like something is missing here, because I think on the last page is when we have submit, right? But there probably needs to be a next button, so the next part. Yeah. OK. And each grant has three main parts, writing out what you're doing and all that stuff, like the actual written proposal. You have the list of citations that back up all your claims. And then you need a proposed budget of how you can use the funds. Can you repeat that last part?





Because their next step is that they need to schedule their grant review virtually. And they will use an embedded calendar to schedule that time and that date for us to review it virtually. After they have submitted that, they end up getting to a confirmation page, letting you know we've got this, this is scheduled. And then they can click on the button that basically says work on your next grant, which will take them right back to here when they're ready. OK. That's great.
