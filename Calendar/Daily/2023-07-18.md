Thirsty to be something that you are not

At the end of Moana, I was looking at the credits and noticed how many different software related roles were in the credits

And I just have never taken the time to notice that, but especially not this type of work being recognized in the credits. It makes sense because I know that these things are obviously needed important but I just had never put two into together on that.

- this is the way

Every time someone asks me if their new business idea is good, my advice is the same:

I have no idea.  
Build an MVP and let the market decide.

I've learned the hard way that I'm dumb as a rock when predicting what will work. Most new ideas I get excited about flop. And the ones I had no expectations from often succeed.

Fortunately, the cost of experimentation is at an all-time low, and it's only going lower.

To build an MVP, all you need is $32 and a weekend's worth of time.

My current strategy is to repeatedly build things and double down on what works. So far it's working.  
Would recommend.
- take this approach at work. Just continue building
