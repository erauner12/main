# Daily Notes
, I'm thankful for being able to just wake up today and, you know, have made it to 30 years old. I mean, it's definitely not ideal, but I'm not going to focus on what's not ideal because that doesn't really matter. All that matters is that I'm able to be thankful for what I do have.

I'm glad that I have people who care about me enough to, you know, wish me a happy birthday and show me that they care about me. Even though I don't necessarily always demonstrate to myself that I care about myself, that doesn't mean that others don't care about me. I'm glad and I'm thankful for the fact that they do.

No one is as hard on yourself as you are, so you just have to kind of remind yourself of that. And you can't deprive others of you.
