Breaking Social Patterns: Growth Without Alcohol

So, I wanted to talk about how I felt at this 36 degrees north event yesterday and my experience there. There was no alcohol, but it was a social scene. Usually, when I'm in social situations, they involve drinking. While I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with drinking, the reason for doing it is important.

If you're just drinking to relieve social pressure when meeting people, it won't mask that feeling. It might make you more open initially and create opportunities for yourself because of your willingness to be open without much effort since you're uninhibited.

However, if the reason behind your drinking is trying not to feel those feelings of anxiety or discomfort in social settings, then after a few beers all those feelings will come back even stronger than before - intensifying them instead of reducing them.

At 36 degrees north office space where I went recently though, I had good conversations with people without needing alcohol. Spending time working and growing with like-minded individuals is what truly brings happiness compared to seeking temporary relief through drinks or online dating apps like Hinge.

I found it easy talking to these passionate people without needing any alcoholic boost – breaking free from my usual pattern which prevented me from growing as an individual due to constant worry over potential cringe moments during interactions.

Just like when coding software programs where errors are expected and need troubleshooting; we should approach our life and social interactions similarly by learning from past mistakes while reflecting on why certain situations made us uncomfortable or anxious.

With this mindset going into Tulsa Tough tonight (an event involving alcohol), remember that excessive consumption isn’t worth losing control over oneself – focus on meaningful connections rather than forcing conversations solely based on liquid courage!

In conclusion: Designing our lives around personal growth experiences rather than using shortcuts (like excessive alcohol) can lead us toward having more genuine relationships as well as being comfortable interacting naturally with others around us!
