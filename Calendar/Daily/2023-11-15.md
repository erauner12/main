# Rollover

# Daily Notes

408

It's using the same mode that does that today. But some modifications are needed. That's it. Cool. Is there a JIRA for that one that I can watch? Or is that the one that is already created? Yeah, I've created JIRA. It's a 408. But it just says that we need to be able to spawn tasks without JIRA tickets. I can do some updates to that once I need some input from you guys. But as for now, it's just internal changes to GIS so that it's actually able to submit the task. And then once it's submitted, we're going to see what we want to have in terms of slight notifications, like how we're going to handle errors if half of the tasks can be submitted or something like that. Cool.

found issue here.

@varsamisk will need to switch back to virtual-docker for these until they are done with rolling out DCIB 23.2. We should be able to use dev-docker after that.
