# Thursday - September 26th 2024

```
Here’s a quick guide for creating a new thread and handling the task updates:

1. **Context Gathering:**

    - Start by accessing the relevant task details from Todoist, ensuring the task ID or project is accurate.
    - Identify the corresponding Slack thread or conversation link related to the task.

2. **Task Review Process:**

    - Review the content of the Slack message. Focus on key details about processes, troubleshooting steps, or instructions that need to be documented.
    - Break down the key points into clear, actionable steps or information for documentation (such as handling specific flags, retrying tasks, etc.).

3. **Comment Update:**
    - Draft a concise comment with a structured format:
        - **Key Instructions/Information:**
            - Briefly summarize the specific process (e.g., sensitive ACK handling, heap adjustment procedures).
        - **Steps or Troubleshooting Notes:**
            - Provide any technical steps or decisions made during the task.
        - **Recommendations for Documentation:**
            - Include any recommendations for adding the instructions to internal documentation, such as Slack integrations or knowledge bases.
4. **Sample Comment:**
   Here's an example of what you can use to create a new thread for future tasks:

---

**Title:** L1 Documentation Update - [Task Name/Topic]
**Slack Link:** [Insert the relevant Slack thread link here]

**Documentation Update Suggestion:**

- **Key Process Description**: [Provide a brief summary of the key task being performed, such as handling heap adjustments, retry processes, etc.]
- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: [Provide a breakdown of the steps involved or troubleshooting steps taken during the task.]
- **Recommendations**: [Mention where this information should be added, e.g., L1 knowledge base, Slack integration documentation, etc.]

# Deployment Revision Verification

## How

1. The Helm chart generates a ConfigMap containing:
   - Stored deployment revisions for each node
   - Full JSON data for each node, including all parameters

2. We can then extract this data and perform local calculations to verify the revisions.

## Usage

### 1. Apply the Helm Chart Changes

First, ensure you've applied the Helm chart changes that introduce the new ConfigMap structure.

### 2. Extract Stored Revisions

```bash
<kubectl command>
```

This command extracts the stored revision values for each node.

### 3. Extract Full Node (s) Data

```bash
<kubectl command>
```

This command extracts the full JSON data for all nodes.

### 4. Inspect Full Node (s) Data (optional)

To view the full JSON data for a specific node:

```bash
jq '.["fe3"]' node_data.json
```

Replace `node_name` with the actual node name you want to inspect.

## Diff

```
<some means of capturing the current config map>

so we can diff it and compare to the last one to see what has changed

```
