# Monday - October 7th 2024

```
can you please help me respond to each and every github comment left on my markdown document.

I will provide the document here, and then we will address each point as we go.

…

I'll provide the comment, and then which line it was left on and then we will address that point in the markdown and then provide rationale/reasoning in the github comment itself:

I'll provide my subjective input as well at the end of each so that you can know how to make the change:

> <line>

<comment>

- <input>

….

here is the first one:

> The wording "at Kubernetes cluster-level scope" is a bit clumsy. Consider "at the scope of a Kubernetes cluster".

 **Providing control at Kubernetes cluster-level scope** for managing multiple customer instances across different namespaces.

- I think this could actually be better said. The confusion between express cluster and kubernetes cluster is what is causing this confusion. kubernetes cluster is like at the DC (datacenter) kubernetes context level. And express cluster-level is like meaning express nodes (pods) in a given namespace.
```

```
- **Providing datacenter-wide control** for managing multiple Express clusters across different namespaces within a Kubernetes cluster.
