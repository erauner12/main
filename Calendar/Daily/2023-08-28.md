Grateful for Broken Streak and Growth

So, I guess what I'm thankful for this morning, even though I'm on call, tired, and have a lot to do this week, is that I broke my no-drinking streak. I feel like I've given myself no reason to feel good, yet I'm okay with it. I feel fine. I'm really glad that I found a way to be. I'm glad that I came across this book that Brittany sent to me.

Even though it's just something she found on TikTok and probably hasn't done as much investigation into this specific realm of neuroscience, philosophy, and religion, I don't know if she has or not. But she just happened to share something with me at the exact time that I needed it, and I think that the timing is key.

I've been hearing so much about these types of experiences or concepts in this book, like recently in Dr. K's videos, and it seemed so abstract to me. Her recommending it, me reading it, and reinforcing it at this time is making it all come together. I'm just really thankful that she shared that with me. She enabled me to move further in my journey and level up without even knowing or realizing it.

I don't know, I'm feeling extremely spiritual right now. But anyway, that's what I'm grateful for today.
