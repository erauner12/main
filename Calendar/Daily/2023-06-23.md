Embracing Emotions and Personal Growth

Lately, I've started to notice my ability to handle situations that bother or distress me. When these feelings arise, I can now more easily recognize them and just sit with the emotion instead of letting it affect me negatively. While I may not be happy about the feeling itself, I accept it without allowing it to cause additional distress.

This reminds me of Bryan's situation with his relationships not working out as he hoped, causing him a lot of stress. Having gone through similar experiences recently, I was able to quickly identify what he was going through. Although these emotions are valid, in my experience, it is better to simply feel them and let them exist without creating more suffering.

By doing so, we can channel this suffering into something productive – accepting its presence as a learning experience rather than an obstacle. This shift in perspective has been a result of my personal growth over the past couple of years due to consistent effort towards self-improvement and adjusting how I react to situations.

Although pursuing this path may not always seem worth it from an outside perspective or even feel good at times internally; ultimately, recognizing that we do not need additional stressors on top of our existing emotions allows us to simply sit with those feelings without judgment.

Reconnecting with Jess: Reflection and Growth

In considering the situation with Jess, I can see how reconnecting with her might be influenced by my feelings. Personally, I've come a long way since we were last together and believe my reasons for wanting to rekindle our relationship are valid. However, I must also acknowledge that she may not be in the right place and doesn't owe me anything.

I've heard that she's invited others to her party and hasn't reciprocated my efforts to be with her despite seeming somewhat interested. As the one who broke up with her, it's understandable if she feels empowered by being wanted again and uses this opportunity to reject me or make me feel bad as a form of payback for past actions.

Although it doesn't feel good, understanding why helps lessen the offense taken because it isn't a significant blow to my ego. While I don't deserve poor treatment just like anyone else, realizing that Jess may be reacting based on previous experiences gives context to her behavior.

Fortunately, control over this situation lies within my own feelings about it. If necessary, I can choose not to take things personally and focus on other interests without Jess being part of them. Though painful and not ideal, accepting this outcome is doable due in part to personal growth allowing for vulnerability when reaching out without feeling needy.

Despite still experiencing lingering emotions such as wondering whether or not she will text back; what matters most is how these emotions are handled. Having learned from past mistakes allows me now better manage situations like these which demonstrates progress made through self-reflection in handling relationships more effectively moving forward.

hope makes true tranquility impossible

Hope is the state of wanting things to be different than they are.
- I kind of feel like what is freeing is continuing to work toward some thing without any hope that it will result in any particular outcome.
- It seems that when you start hoping that it’s going to result in something, is the same time that you start to lose your appreciation for what that thing or activity is.
- It seems like this is what takes you away from being in the moment. Appreciating the time that you do have doing whatever it is.
- You’re kind of robbing yourself of what truly enjoying the thing actually is. For some idea of what you think that it is or should be.
- All you have is this moment and nothing else
