A fool is known by his Speech; and a wise man by silence.

Live below your means  
Beginner: If you can't afford it twice, don't buy it.

Advanced: If it's more than 10% of your income don't buy it.

Pro: If it's not making you more money, only buy it if your assets can pay for it.

- interesting to look at mindful minutes.
- Could be a good way to encourage yourself to actually do it. Because just like you work out, you can similarly see how good it feels to be consistent

I don't feel the same level of growth/ fulfillment when I'm on call as I do when I am building and modifying things within the framework  
mhalva 1h ago  
agreed  
… there is no fulfilment and very little growth on MEC oncalls … still the same issues repeating itself (OOM, blocked pump etc.) with  
SRE having no influence/power to get these really fixed  
it would be different if there are oncalls for provisioner …  
… then you can take (almost) every  
issue and convert it into (code) fix, so it won't
- mhalva and I talking about oncall
