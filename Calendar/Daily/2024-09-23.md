## Express Helm Chart Role System

## Overview

The Express Helm chart now supports a flexible role-based configuration system. This system allows for more granular control over node behavior and settings based on their assigned roles.

## Available Roles

The chart includes the following predefined roles:

1. **Default**: The base role applied to all nodes if no specific role is assigned.
2. **Frontend**: Applied to nodes designated as frontend servers.
3. **Backend**: Applied to nodes designated as backend servers.
4. **Synchronizer**: A special role for nodes responsible for synchronization tasks.

## Role Configuration

Roles are configured in the `values.yaml` file under the `roles` key. Each role can have its own set of configurations that will be applied to nodes assigned that role.

Example configuration:

```yaml
roles:
  Default:
    # Default settings for all roles
    startupTimeoutHours: 1
  Frontend:
    # Frontend-specific settings
    startupTimeoutHours: 1
    # Add other Frontend-specific settings here
  Backend:
    # Backend-specific settings
    startupTimeoutHours: 1
    # Add other Backend-specific settings here
  Synchronizer:
    # Synchronizer-specific settings
    startupTimeoutHours: 72
    # Add other Synchronizer-specific settings here
  # Custom roles can be added here
```

## Assigning Roles to Nodes

Roles are assigned to nodes in the `nodes` section of the `values.yaml` file. If no role is explicitly assigned, nodes will default to their node type (Frontend or Backend) as their role.

Example node configuration:

```yaml
nodes:
  be:
    nodeType: Backend
    # Role is implicitly Backend due to nodeType
  fe1:
    nodeType: Frontend
    role: Synchronizer
    # Explicitly assigned Synchronizer role
  fe2:
    nodeType: Frontend
    # Role is implicitly Frontend due to nodeType
```

## Role Inheritance and Overrides

1. All roles inherit settings from the Default role.
2. Node type roles (Frontend and Backend) can override Default settings.
3. Explicitly assigned roles (like Synchronizer) can override both Default and node type settings.
4. Node-specific configurations take the highest precedence and can override any role-based settings.

## Synchronizer Role

The Synchronizer role is a special role typically assigned to one Frontend node in the cluster. This role can have specific configurations suited for synchronization tasks, such as extended startup timeouts.

Important notes:

- Only one node should be assigned the Synchronizer role.
- The Synchronizer role should only be assigned to a Frontend node.

## Custom Roles

You can define custom roles by adding them to the `roles` section in `values.yaml`. Custom roles will inherit from the Default role and can include any specific settings needed.

## Best Practices

1. Use the Default role for settings that should apply to all nodes.
2. Use the Frontend and Backend roles for type-specific configurations.
3. Assign the Synchronizer role to only one Frontend node that will handle synchronization tasks.
4. Create custom roles for specific use cases that don't fit into the predefined roles.
5. Be mindful of the inheritance hierarchy when setting configurations to avoid unexpected overrides.

## Validation

The chart includes validation to ensure:

- All used roles are properly defined.
- The Synchronizer role, if used, is assigned to a Frontend node.
- Node ordering is consistent, whether explicitly defined or dynamically generated.

By leveraging this role-based system, you can create more flexible and maintainable Express cluster configurations.
