# Thursday - March 14th 2024


We should be able to control which version gets picked in the dcr workflow itself.

Ex:  
[Update platform.yaml by erauner · Pull Request #21381 · medallia/configuration](https://github.medallia.com/medallia/configuration/pull/21381)

Whatever is configured here, should update the DCR instance file in the instance configure step (if it already exists).

Going to be moving some additional chart changes into `0.0.2` as well and then test against `systemdcrtest2` in `yul1` with jira workflow to make sure everything is good.
