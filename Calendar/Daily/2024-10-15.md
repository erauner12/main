```
helm template my-release ./master_charts/express --values overlays/yul1/systemdcrtest3/values.yaml
```

```
Error: values don't meet the specifications of the schema(s) in the following chart(s):
express:
- (root): Additional property commonExpressConfig is not allowed
- (root): Additional property guardEnabled is not allowed
```



I’ve worked out a temporary workaround based on our current tools, which provides some of the functionality we need, but it's still just that, a hack. This approach is making it more difficult than necessary to properly track changes to the Helm chart, which is a key concern of mine. Here is some info on the controlled directory copying method workaround I’ve been using. I've documented how it works and wrote some scripts to control the interactions to mimic a proper semantic version control system:

[Improve Helm Chart Management Process and Documentation by erauner · Pull Request #73436 · Atlas/deployment](https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/deployment/pull/73436)

Given the constraints of using a beta feature, I understand the hesitation. I have it as well. However, I believe that testing this in `yul1`, where we're already doing much of our initial testing, gives us a low-risk opportunity to separate the Helm chart from the test clusters and gain clarity or not this testing workflow works well for us.

Regardless of how we move forward, the problem is still that managing the Helm chart the way we are now (in the same repository as the values) is proving to be more cumbersome than it really needs to be. Having this capability in `yul1` until we land on which way we want to properly externalize the helm chart versions will be a huge help in the immediate term. In the meantime, can use this to get the repo setup and have the history/changes in a single place with branches etc.

```
I’ve noticed that the main loop feels crowded. While it functions well and I appreciate its ability to make the debug follow the precedence order, I wonder if certain parts of the main loop could be relocated. This would allow the main loop to focus on a specific role, making it simpler while still controlling everything. I want to avoid making it too complicated. Additionally, I’d like to understand the difference between the section for calculating additional parameters and the section for derived values. Is there a better place to position these sections to ensure clarity for anyone adding new elements? This way, it won’t be accidentally overlooked.
