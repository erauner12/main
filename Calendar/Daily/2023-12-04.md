# Daily Notes


For the two PRs that I proposed, I just looked at your comments. I was wondering if there was anything that we could do to be able to create those images like off of the branch. Well, I guess in this case it wouldn't even match a JIRA so that it wouldn't work. I just wanted to… Look, if you want you can always build it locally, right? And push it. True. I guess I've never pushed that from local. You can. You can. Just create a tag, like the same way. So what you do is like… So the pipeline will use this, where is the pattern, will use this path, right? Right here. So you should use the same path and label it the way you want. Ah, okay. And you just say, you just tag it. So I do that sometimes. I want to show you one with a tag, okay, this one for example. So you just say that the tag will be this, you need to be in the directory that the docker file is, which is the main directory, and you just use the same path and you just put a tag, whatever you want. No cache. Okay. Right? And no cache is like for me, I just wanted for that specific build that I was doing, I just didn't want to take the layers from cache because it was creating a problem for me. Anyway. So then you label it as you want and when you do push, you just say docker push and you keep the same, all this should be the same, whatever you used in the build. Okay. Right? And that's it. If you want to do it manually. Okay. I'm going to try that. Yeah, but always use either virtual or live here so we don't put garbage in relics. Okay. About the speech, Ivan, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Are you still working on that? Well, yeah, just I'm looking at his comment. So it's a completely unrelated to speech why we were getting there. So I'll finish it up this morning. Okay. But I wasn't sure if you were able to finish that out manually or if you were waiting on me to fix the pipeline so that you could continue it. No, no. Let's, let's fix it. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, I'll have that first thing here. Okay. Yeah. So. Yeah. One more thing. I spoke with Jesse this morning and he told me that.

to Slack channels, but probably we'll need to read conversations, right? Read the channels. I don't know. There is a set of permissions that we will need. Yeah. Because we also want to read the conversations, right, and threads. Yeah. I'll investigate exactly what permissions we need before I – I'll add it to the – I think you can start the request, but part of the request is, like, telling them which permissions you need. So I would even start the request today and, like, fill it in, because they're not going to do anything about it, like, at once. Yeah. Like, just on the same day you create it. Okay. Anyway. Okay, let's do this one.

I put it as a message in a Kafka topic, and then have the router, which will be the consumer of this topic, to grab it, do something with it, which can be something simple, like just commenting on a Slack channel, or something like that. And this will be our POC, let's say, about the router, and from there we can add more and more and start making it as we want. Okay, that sounds pretty good, okay. Okay, so, but now I see, I still have capacity. Okay, yeah, I didn't put that one, restructure this one, so I need to set it, assign it to main. And I still have capacity, I think it's 24. 26, do you have any other priority? Luis, do you want us to work? No, not really. No, no, no, no, no, no, I agree with that. You're responsible. Okay, okay, this one, did we put this one? I need to just do that one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been telling you, you're not listening. I know, I know, I know. Okay, then I don't know, like maybe.

From here because now yes, you created that we created that sprint, I guess and I I can add them in this one I cannot all the Well, that's a lot easier Yeah Okay, but now I cannot start the sprint Which I guess louis you are coming in with that and I will send you that link See if you press that button again, we start that thing Um And so if you create issue right there would that create the issue directly inside of the sprint And yeah, it's just started in this and we could have the next sprint, um Well, never mind. Look from what I understood you you Yeah, you created a scram board You can put your backlog as the sets because that's what is it says even here the backlog And then you add them to a sprint and then you're supposed to click start sprint. I didn't realize it was as simple as that um Yeah, me neither. I'm also trying But can you see that button, uh Louis yeah. Yeah, just refresh the page. Okay Very sorry Nice. Oh sweet. Okay an active sprint now, there you go. Okay. Okay. Yeah That's good. That's great Okay, but I think next time next time I will create a board from all the backlog and then we can just start them directly there and what we're doing with planning with the With the tags like we don't need to because like it's gonna be here. Okay, that's cool Nice, how do you how do you can you share that? Yeah, so we'll have a board for each two-week sprint like a separate board Yeah, okay And I assume that here in active sprints you will get more or actually no because then we will complete the sprint and Okay, that's that's accurate. Yeah, it's from 4th to 18th, right? Yeah, okay Yeah, okay, that's cool. Okay, that's cool. Thanks. So now we have a board I'll share it with you. Yeah Check him because you should be able to Just start the screen because you are in a screen manager right now I don't know but some some people told me that it's it's a bit weird like the when it comes to

and Then you go to to do and from there you can only go to in progress and from there You can only go to blocked or whatever blocked or complete or not required Yeah This is better. This is good. This is good enough for now. I think it's okay. It's okay because like then you get into a Different kind of message because then if you have something blocked You are supposed to have an arrow to put it back in progress and from there like I don't know I don't know Lewis do whatever you want man, like with this gun follow, but I don't want to do anything else with I'm just thinking about all that's important to me is to Designate whenever I have something in progress What I can I can't do anything with that. It's blocked and if it's not blocked then mmm, then I should be working on that until it's blocked again, like and if I yeah, it's done and And yeah But I guess it is that what you're trying to do Louis so to make it right or something if it's blocked or something like that Yeah, can you refresh the page right now? Yeah. Yeah Just We don't see what's in the backlog, that's good. We only see what's to do. That's what I'm doing now. Yeah in progress done perfect Nice Okay, that's

## Title
Enable ArgoCD Notifications for Express in Cloud Deployment


**Objective:** Implement ArgoCD notifications for the Express project within our cloud-deployment infrastructure.

We've received several requests and observed instances where syncing issues in the Express project have caused operational blockers. For example, there have been queries about merging PRs when certain applications are out of sync (referencing [PR 10470](https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/cloud-deployment/pull/10470) and [PR 10468](https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/cloud-deployment/pull/10468/files)).

**Specific Request:**
* **Issue:** Syncing issues in the Express project affecting changes to Guardian.
* **Observation:** The ProdSvc team currently lacks proactive measures to address application sync failures, leading to extended periods (15-30+ days) without successful syncs.

**Proposed Solution:**
* **Proposal:** Enable notifications on a per Express cluster level to gain awareness of application sync issues in a timely manner.
* **Benefit:** This will allow the ProdSvc team to be more proactive in addressing these issues, reducing the risk of operational blocks due to sync failures.

**Implementation Suggestion:**
* Update and configure `cloud-deployment-infra/notifications-configmap.yaml` to enable ArgoCD notifications specifically for the Express project within OCI.
* Ensure notifications are tailored to alert about sync status, operation issues, and health status of the Express project.

**Additional Context:**
* The changes are intended to improve the operational efficiency and responsiveness of the team in managing the Express project within our cloud-deployment infrastructure.
