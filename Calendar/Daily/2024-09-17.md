# Test ArgoCD Health Resources Using Pod Status, Phases, and Init Containers

## Related PRs
- https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/express-operator/pull/188
- https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/deployment-infra/pull/11688
- https://github.medallia.com/Atlas/express-operator/pull/187

## Reason
The purpose of this test is to control the health check from ArgoCD, leveraging pod status and phases without implementing complex logic within the operator.

## Changes
- Utilizing more pod conditions (`PodScheduled`, `Initialized`, `ContainersReady`, `Ready`)
- Specific handling for the `express` container in the Frontend/Backend check
- Removed the time-based check for the `Progressing` state
- Added a `Succeeded` phase check
- Implemented detailed checks for init containers with specific timeouts
- Enhanced express container state checks

## Rationale
Updating the ArgoCD health check resources to provide more accurate and detailed health status information. This change leverages the existing pod conditions, container statuses, and init container statuses available in the Frontend/Backend custom resource's status, which are already updated by the operator's reconciliation loop.

Key improvements:
- More granular health status based on multiple pod conditions and init container states
- Specific handling for init containers with customized timeout periods
- Detailed express container status checks
- Alignment with Kubernetes native concepts and best practices
- Reduced likelihood of false positives or negatives in health reporting

## Example
```yaml
apiVersion: express.medallia.com/v2alpha1
kind: Frontend
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: express
        readinessProbe:
          exec:
            command:
            - sh
            - -c
            - |
              ADMIN_STATUS=$(curl -s --connect-timeout 5 --max-time 5 'http://localhost:9100/.admin?cmd=status')
              if [[ "$ADMIN_STATUS" == "ready" || "$ADMIN_STATUS" == "hidden" ]]; then
                exit 0
              else
                exit 1
              fi
          initialDelaySeconds: 120
          periodSeconds: 30
          failureThreshold: 3
          timeoutSeconds: 15
        startupProbe:
          exec:
            command:
            - sh
            - -c
            - |
              ADMIN_STATUS=$(curl -s --connect-timeout 5 --max-time 5 'http://localhost:9100/.admin?cmd=status')
              if [[ "$ADMIN_STATUS" == "waiting" || "$ADMIN_STATUS" == "ready" ]]; then
                exit 0
              else
                exit 1
              fi
          failureThreshold: 30
          periodSeconds: 10
```

## Health Check Scenarios

1. Pending pod with init containers:
   - Pod phase: Pending
   - Init containers: Checked for specific timeouts (e.g., write-caches: 1h, history-update: 2h, copy-caches: 10m)  
   Result: Status = "Progressing" if within time limits, "Degraded" if exceeded or failed

2. Running pod with all conditions met:
   - Pod phase: Running
   - All conditions (PodScheduled, Initialized, ContainersReady, Ready): True
   - Express container: Ready  
   Result: Status = "Healthy", Message = "Pod is running and all containers are ready"

3. Running pod with containers not ready:
   - Pod phase: Running
   - PodScheduled and Initialized: True
   - ContainersReady and Ready: False
   - Express container: Not Ready  
   Result: Status = "Progressing", Message = "Pod is running but containers are not yet ready: â€¦"

4. Degraded pod:
   - Pod phase: Running
   - Any condition is False
   - Express container: Various states (e.g., CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff)  
   Result: Status = "Degraded", Message depends on the specific issue
