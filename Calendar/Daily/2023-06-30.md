- not letting the storm abrupt momentum (in terms of energy)
- Still going on walks and getting around even when I could not work outout
- I feel that the moments of reflection/calm are just important to keep with as the workouts/walks are
- What is not as easy to measure is getting out and talking to people, but I have been trying to stay onto top of this as well

You need a goal.  
You need a project.  
You need something to invest energy into.  
Like when you buy an expensive item and feel like you need to use it.  
When you invest enough energy into a goal, you will feel obligated to achieve it. [*](https://app.napkin.one/t/x1JXz53cGDoyK7g3EZqf) #napkin_idea

Try questioning your emotions with typingmind

I think itâ€™s probably best done with typing mind just because you can have an interaction. Like a back-and-forth between it.

Consistency in Gym Habits: A New Approach

The key to my consistent gym habit, unlike previous attempts, is the absence of specific goals. Earlier, I worked out with aims such as improving my appearance for dating or losing weight. However, once these objectives were met, I lost motivation and discontinued exercising.

Nowadays, I go to the gym without expecting any particular outcome; interestingly enough it's this mindset that keeps me going regularly. [*](https://app.napkin.one/t/TdFqOt5eruZhprQeDYm6) #napkin_idea

The physical exercise has become a reflection of my daily mental activities rather than an obligation or expectation driven task. Irrespective of whether I want to do it or not doesn't affect my dedication any longer.
