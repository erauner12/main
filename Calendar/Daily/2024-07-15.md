# Monday - July 15th 2024
---

1. Deployment Process Improvement:

    - The team is working on a new framework for handling deployments, starting with ad-hoc deployments and aiming to scale up to group deployments.
    - The new system will provide better tracking, visibility, and role-based compliance.

2. User Interface and Visibility:

    - The team demonstrated a new UI for tracking deployments, including status updates and detailed logs.
    - There's a need to improve the summary view to show progress across multiple deployments, including stages and failure points.

3. Integration with Existing Systems:

    - The new system will integrate with JIRA for ticket tracking and auditing purposes.
    - Slack integration for notifications and troubleshooting threads will be maintained.

4. Compliance and Authorization:

    - Role-based access control is being implemented to ensure only authorized personnel can perform specific actions.
    - Documentation of roles and permissions for the tool, JIRA workflows, and Slack workflows is needed.

5. Reporting and Monitoring:
    - The team needs to develop more detailed reporting at both cluster and node levels.
    - There's interest in replicating and improving upon the current manual reporting process.

Next Actions:

1. Set up a follow-up call with the full team, including Camille, to discuss:

    - The next stage of tool design and requirements
    - Current scripts and automation used for tracking deployment progress
    - Detailed reporting needs at cluster and node levels

2. Create and share a list of operations needed for regular deployment activities.
3. Document roles and permissions for the tool, JIRA workflows, and Slack workflows.
4. Implement and test the new system for ad-hoc deployments, including:

    - Configuration changes
    - No-ops deployments
    - Cache rebuilds
    - Single instance deployments

5. Design and implement improvements to the summary view UI, including:

    - Progress tracking across multiple deployments
    - Failure point identification
    - Deployment stage visibility

6. Develop a plan for scaling the system to handle group deployments (e.g., "lightning" and "thunder" phases).
7. Create a temporary Slack channel for ongoing communication and information sharing about the new deployment system.
