Marriott

[configuration/variables/sc4.medallia.com/marriott/express/slugProperties.var at master · medallia/configuration](https://github.medallia.com/medallia/configuration/blob/master/variables/sc4.medallia.com/marriott/express/slugProperties.var)

Why is marriott running a static?

```
marriott-c1-upd1
```

Inspect properties

```
marriott-c1-upd1 | Y       | Not ready | post_thunder | N/A                                      | express-e686.158_RMT-26174.13 | N/A                                      | express-e686.158_RMT-26174.13 | -          | 0/0        |
```

Ask sergio from that groovy.

We don't need to update the express version, only the configuration.

L1 needs to update to this configuration version

- ? Is there any reason we could not update the config hash

How many farmers, 20

80GB per farmer

Will need to create a namespace

---

If there is some groovy we could run across all the clusters

Inspect properties

Slug

[clusterworkdirs-sc4/marriott-c1-upd1/slug.properties at master · DeployerConfig/clusterworkdirs-sc4](https://github.medallia.com/DeployerConfig/clusterworkdirs-sc4/blob/master/marriott-c1-upd1/slug.properties)

What Adam mentioned here is likely what we need to do:  
https://medallia.slack.com/archives/C070UU168N4/p1713895526410069?thread_ts=1713887020.124569&cid=C070UU168N4

now we need to check which IPs to use for marriott
