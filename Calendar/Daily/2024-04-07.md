# Sunday - April 7th 2024

## Tasks

Non-@focus tasks that are overdue and due today, or due today within the next hour, or due today with no specific time set.

@focus tasks that are either: - Overdue with no specific time set - Overdue and due today (regardless of time set) - Due today or tomorrow with no specific time set

This way, @focus tasks with a specific time set will only appear if they are overdue and due today, while @focus tasks without a specific time set will appear if they are overdue, due today, or due tomorrow.
