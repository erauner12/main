[[DCR JIRA Status]]

Creating a JIRA ticket involves several steps, and it's important to include enough detail to communicate the intent and scope of the work effectively. Here's how you might structure the ticket based on your request:

**Title: Decouple Helm Chart Updates from Prov-ng Code**

**Type:** Task

**Priority:** [Choose one: Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest]

**Assignee:** [Your Name or the name of the person responsible for the task]

**Reporter:** [Your Name]

**Labels:** versioning, helm-chart, deployment, argocd

**Sprint:** [Assign to relevant sprint if applicable]

**Description:**

This task aims to decouple the process of updating Helm charts from the provisioning-ng codebase to streamline versioning and deployment. Currently, helm chart versions are hardcoded within the code, which is not only prone to errors but also adds unnecessary complexity to our deployment process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Implement a dynamic method to determine helm chart versions without hardcoding them.
2. Ensure that the new method can retrieve the correct helm chart version for different platforms.
3. Validate that the changes do not affect the deployment process adversely.
4. Update documentation to reflect the new versioning process.
5. Code changes should pass all existing continuous integration checks.

**Code Example:**

Current code snippet from `prov_platform/mec/instance_configure.py`:

```python
def determine_helm_chart_version(self, platform: str) -> str:
    if platform == "dcr":
        return self.get_step_modifier("helm_chart", "helm_0.0.1")

    if platform == "mec":
        chart_version = "helm_2.0.2" if DC.cloud_dc(self.dc()) else "helm_0.0.3"
        return self.get_step_modifier("helm_chart", chart_version)
```

Proposed code change:

```python
# New method to dynamically determine helm chart version
def determine_helm_chart_version(self, platform: str) -> str:
    # Logic to dynamically fetch the current version from a centralized version control or configuration
    chart_version = self.get_current_chart_version(platform)
    return self.get_step_modifier("helm_chart", chart_version)

# Example method to fetch the current chart version (to be implemented)
def get_current_chart_version(self, platform: str) -> str:
    # Fetch the version from a JSON file, database, or environment variable
    # This is a placeholder for actual implementation
    return "0.0.3"
```

**Additional Information:**

For reference and context, see the related document "Versioning Process Improvement Proposal" and the current file structure in the repository at [prov-platform/mec/instance_configure.py](https://github.medallia.com/medallia/provisioning-ng/blob/master/prov_platform/mec/instance_configure.py).

Remember to replace placeholder text with actual information like your name, sprint number, etc. Also, ensure that the ticket is created in the correct project within your JIRA instance and that you have the appropriate permissions to create tickets.
