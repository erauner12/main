# Daily Notes


Your message is quite technical and specific, but it could benefit from being more concise and structured for clarity. Here's an improved version:

Here is a sneak peek in case you were interested, in the same way we should remove this reliance on clusterconfig, I believe we should also re-think the relationship of an express instance to the configuration repo. It's yet another hurdle that we have to jump through any time a change is needed.

For instance, consider the configuration at medallia/configuration/itruffattest/express/dcr-farm.  
^ This is how we were initially going to manage DCR before I started using helm. This is how we are currently managing configuration in express because it is static.  
Now that changes to express code is enabling a dynamic topology, We can replace this extensive configuration with just three lines of code using simple templating techniques, as seen here: Atlas/deployment/dcr.yaml lines 100-102

We need to minimize our dependency on individual config hashes for each Express instance. This change will significantly reduce operational overhead and simplify things. Only what is global to all instances should be in configuration

Before DCR begins:  

```bash
nodeCount: 0
enableSynchronizer: false
```


start HU  

```bash
nodeCount: 0  
enableSynchronizer: true
```


Start Farmers:  

```bash
nodeCount: 3  
enableSynchronizer: true
```


Take down farmers, leave sync node on:  

```bash
nodeCount: 0  
enableSynchronizer: true
```


Take down sync node:  

```bash
nodeCount: 0  
EnableSynchronizer: false
```




Before DCR begins:
```
nodeCount: 10
enableSynchronizer: false
enableFarmers: false
```

start HU  

```
nodeCount: 10
enableSynchronizer: true
enableFarmers: false
```

Start Farmers:  

```bash
nodeCount: 10
enableSynchronizer: true
enableFarmers: true
```

Take down farmers, leave sync node on:  

```bash
nodeCount: 10 
enableSynchronizer: true
enableFarmers: false
```

Take down sync node:

```bash
nodeCount: 10
EnableSynchronizer: false
enableFarmers: false
```


I think this makes sense because as long as DCR actually starts and it is being monitored, we can just use the deployment repo to increase the amount to make the progress happen faster, ex: Mid rebuild, too slow  

```bash
nodeCount: 10
enableSynchronizer: true
enableFarmers: true
```


```bash
nodeCount: 20
enableSynchronizer: true
enableFarmers: true
```

in this way, we can also retain the node count from previous runs without having to look in git history to see it. It will just continue to be set that way until `enableFarmers` is set to true again.
