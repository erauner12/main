# Deployment Revision Validation Script for Express Operator

## Overview

This pull request introduces a new script, `verify_revisions.py`, designed to validate and compare deployment revisions for the Express operator. This tool is crucial for ensuring the correct functioning of our Express deployments and streamlining our workflow.

## Why This Matters

The Express operator relies heavily on deployment revisions to determine when and how to update nodes. Incorrect revisions can lead to several issues:

1. Unnecessary node updates, causing downtime
2. Failure to update nodes when needed, leading to outdated configurations
3. Inconsistencies between what we expect to deploy and what actually gets deployed

Manually verifying these revisions is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical for large-scale deployments. This script automates the process, making it easier, more efficient, and more reliable to manage our Express deployments.


## Key Features

1. **Flexible Comparison**: Compare against live cluster state or local files.
2. **Detailed Output**: Verbose mode for in-depth information about revisions.
3. **Safety Checks**: Prevents applying changes if discrepancies are found.
4. **Automatic Helm Template Generation**: Generates and uses the latest Helm output.

## Benefits

1. **Time-Saving**: Automates a previously manual and error-prone process.
2. **Increased Reliability**: Reduces the risk of human error in revision management.
3. **Improved Workflow**: Makes it easier to test and verify changes before applying them.
4. **Better Visibility**: Provides clear insights into revision discrepancies.

## Importance for Reviewers

Understanding and correctly managing these deployment revisions is crucial for the proper functioning of our Express operator. This script makes it significantly easier and more efficient to handle these revisions, reducing the risk of errors and improving our overall deployment process.

By automating this process, we're not just saving time â€“ we're enhancing the reliability and consistency of our Express deployments. This tool will be particularly valuable as we scale our operations and manage more complex deployments.

## Next Steps

1. Review the script and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
2. Consider integrating this script into our CI/CD pipeline for automated checks.
3. Discuss potential expansions of the script's functionality for other aspects of our deployment process.

Your thorough review and testing of this script are greatly appreciated. It represents a significant step forward in our ability to manage Express deployments efficiently and reliably.

# Friday - September 27th 2024


Here's a summary of the current issue, focusing on the core problem and requirements without delving into implementation details:

The current deployment process for Express clusters has a significant limitation: it doesn't allow for stopping the deployment mid-way through, which is a crucial requirement for the operations team. The main issues and requirements are:

1. Current Limitation: The Helm chart applies all Custom Resources (CRs) for Frontends and Backends simultaneously, making it impossible to pause or stop the deployment process once it has begun.

we should be able to hit the terminate button in argocd to prevent any further syncing to resources beyond the one that is being synced immeditately

ex:

apply changes to fe1 (wait for pod to become healthy with latest change -> apply changes to fe2 (wait for pod to become healthy with latest change

1. Desired Behavior: The ability to apply resources (Frontend/Backend CRs) one at a time, allowing for potential intervention or stopping of the deployment process between each resource application.
2. Health Check Requirement: Ensure that each pod associated with a CR is not only healthy but also running the latest deployment revision before proceeding to the next CR. (still trying to determine if the latest deployment revision is necessary?, if so perhaps the configmap can serve a purpose here?)
3. Deployment Order: Maintain a specific order of deployment for the CRs, likely based on their naming convention or annotations.
4. Pod Health Priority: Continue to prioritize pod health in the overall health check process, as the pod's status is more indicative of the actual application state than the CR itself. But don't proceed to the next CR until the current one is done
5. Consistency: Ensure that all components of a cluster (Frontends and Backends) are updated consistently, avoiding partial updates that could lead to version mismatches or operational issues.

The challenge is to modify the existing deployment process, likely involving changes to the Helm chart, Argo CD configuration, and health check scripts, to achieve this more controlled and interruptible deployment flow while maintaining the integrity and consistency of the Express cluster deployments.




```
helm --debug template foo master_charts/express --values overlays/yul1/systemdcrtest3/values.yaml > output.yaml
```
```
kubectl apply --context yul1 -f output.yaml
```

# Deployment Revision Verification

## How

1. The Helm chart generates a ConfigMap containing:
   - Stored deployment revisions for each node
   - Full JSON data for each node, including all parameters

2. We can then extract this data and perform local calculations to verify the revisions.

## Usage

### 1. Apply the Helm Chart Changes

First, ensure you've applied the Helm chart changes that introduce the new ConfigMap structure.

### 2. Extract Stored Revisions

```bash
<extract revision changes>
```

This command extracts the stored revision values for each node.

### 3. Extract Full Node Data

```bash
<extract configmap data>
```

This command extracts the full JSON data for all nodes.

### 4. Inspect Full Node Data (optional)

To view the full JSON data for a specific node:

```bash
< we should be able to inspect all nodes or a single node>
```

Replace `node_name` with the actual node name you want to inspect.

## Diff

```
<give me a way to diff it>
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any discrepancies between stored and calculated revisions:

1. Check the full node data to ensure all parameters are correct.
2. Verify that the Helm chart is correctly generating the ConfigMap.
3. Ensure that the local calculation method matches the one used in the Helm chart.
