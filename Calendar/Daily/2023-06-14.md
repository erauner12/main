On-Call Challenges and Proactive Problem Solving

This morning, I woke up and realized that I was on call. Since then, things have been more challenging than usual – even simple tasks like eating breakfast and getting excited about the day ahead. I believe this is partly due to some mistakes I made yesterday and the fact that being on call isn't something I aspire to do long-term.

I've come to understand that my skills are better utilized in a different way. My strength lies in thinking productively beforehand, which GPT has helped me align with my actual responsibilities and implementation strategies. This is what I prefer doing instead of constantly responding to emergencies or trying to save the day when things go wrong.

Being on-call may provide job security for some people who handle these issues daily, but it doesn't seem sustainable for everyone involved, including the company as a whole. If there's an option to set things up so we don't need proprietary information every time we step in, why continue down this path? There are better solutions available.

Ultimately, I'd like to focus my efforts on solving problems proactively rather than juggling both reactive responses and other responsibilities simultaneously.
