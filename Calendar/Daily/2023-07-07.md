## Journal

Q: What do you want to remember from today?  
A: I want to remember what it felt like to go and work out like I did. I had an idea of what it was going to be like to hit the second set. I asked Will to help me, and he provided all kinds of advice. But the biggest advice that he helped me with, was adjusting my breathing technique. and I truly felt it made all the difference and terms of pushing myself to get that weight up

Q: What did I do to be the change I want to see in the world?  
A: I made changes to a process at work and have proposed the changes to my coworker. I feel that the changes that I proposed are going to make a big difference and how the flow currently works

Q: What problem did I encounter today? How did I solve it?  
A: I encountered the problem of trying to figure out how to make the process of building the python Pkg locally more easy. Because it didn’t seem to be working. my goal is to make the process of building the package easier. Because I feel like there’s a lot of steps in between. so I think the steps that I took will help move us in the right direction. But yeah, in order to make the changes that were necessary I had to Trace back through what initially worked. And reference how this worked to know what I needed to change in the code that Camille wrote.

It is possible to be happy without anything needed. just identify with next thought in consciousness

You laughed when you read googling symptoms was a problem

Well, you technically are googling the symptoms of the brain that you have

All the thoughts that you feel are going through your head and our Sawyer difficult to work with and manage

This is essentially the same as googling symptoms of something that’s actually a real problem that’s happening

[[The ringing of the bell, every minute is just a reminder to begin again]]

Not necessarily even changing the weight, but just making it harder on yourself

This is what I feel RPE is

There is no “right” way to do things.

Trying to look for such a way will result in trying many things that are not actually solving your direct problem

Take the personal out of the thoughts

I think this would be useful for the way I want my thought catalog to look.

Because what I think is the case is that I don’t want me advertising this and showing with people to be this thing that I’m trying to press them with

If anything, what I want is for them to find you know things they disagree with in the things that I send them and you know point those things out to me so I can collaborate on response.

Almost as if there was a start in their mind that they contributed to this

anxiety about the lack of progress. shame of failure. prove to the world that I am worthy of love
