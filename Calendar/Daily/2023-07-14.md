# Daily Notes

Well I did fall off last night. Played video games and ended up drinking a bunch and as a result, eating a bunch of food, even though I was already done for the day and that regard.

I don’t really feel that bad about it but I obviously don’t wanna make a habit out of it.

I’m glad that I’m able to see it for what it actually is

I'm glad that I'm able to allow myself to fall off.


It’s strange how my brain can just like “pause” being depressed for awhile—enjoy friends, be happy, everything is great—then things get quiet and my brain remembers “oh, right - we’re depressed.”
