# Saturday - July 6th 2024

Great work on updating the package and publishing it to your own PyPI server! To use this updated version in your project, you'll need to modify your project's configuration to use your custom PyPI server and then update the package. Here's how you can do it:

1. Add your custom PyPI server to your project's configuration:

    Create or edit a `pyproject.toml` file in your project root (if you're using Poetry) and add the following:

    ```toml
    [[tool.poetry.source]]
    name = "my_pypi"
    url = "https://pypi.erauner.synology.me/"
    priority = "supplemental"
    ```

    This tells Poetry to look in your custom PyPI server for packages.

2. Update your `requirements.txt` file:

    If you're using a `requirements.txt` file, you can specify the custom index URL:

    ```
    --extra-index-url https://pypi.erauner.synology.me/
    synctodoist==0.3.4
    ```

3. Update the package:

    If you're using Poetry:

    ```
    poetry add synctodoist@0.3.4 --source my_pypi
    ```

    If you're using pip:

    ```
    pip install --upgrade --index-url https://pypi.erauner.synology.me/ synctodoist==0.3.4
    ```

4. Verify the installation:

    You can check that the correct version is installed by running:

    ```
    pip show synctodoist
    ```
