# Daily Notes

I made progress tackling the large weeds in my backyard, although there are still some remaining. I mowed the lawn without using a bag due to its long length. I plan to return during the week, possibly tomorrow and Tuesday, to bag the grass, as there is a substantial amount.

Today, I focused on cutting the grass, and now I need to scoop it up and bag it separately. Despite the work that still needs to be done, I feel satisfied with the progress I've made.

Signed up for another therapy session which I feel good about.
