daily_improve: >
  Mostly because I knew it was complex problem that was going to
  involve a lot of steps. And I knew I was not going to take the time to do it
  at any point unless I just tackled it. I could have done a better job at
  balancing my time on the thing I wanted to fix with work. the fact is, that
  you are always going to have changes you want to make to your system. So it is
  not a good excuse that you wanted to make changes. That will always be the
  case. You can’t just drop everything else just because you are interested in
  one thing to the point of obsession.
daily_grateful_for: >
  I am grateful that I have a job that I can have days like
  these where I fall off my grind and get distracted by other things. These days
  are inevitable.
daily_main_focus: >
  Answering this one at night, because I didn’t really focus
  much on work today. I focused on fixing and improving obsidian. I focused
  mainly on fixing the metadata conflict in obsidian.
