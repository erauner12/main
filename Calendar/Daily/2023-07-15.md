I have learned to seek happiness by limiting my desires, rather than by trying to satisfy them.

But life isn't always fair. We learn this early on.  
Life is far more interested in our growth.  
And relationships - specifically romantic ones, whether they last or not, are about growing. [*](https://app.napkin.one/t/zNbgwRMo5N7YQQmmj172) #napkin_idea

[Exciting-Eye-5478's comment on "Should you be an observer who doesn’t integrate himself in the world or an observer who does?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/14zqah5/should_you_be_an_observer_who_doesnt_integrate/jrzgzcm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_content=1&utm_term=22&context=3)
- In my experience, the more you practice observation of yourself and the world around you, the more clear you become on knowing when to insert yourself into a situation and when to take a step back.
