Certainly! The change to `* on (meta_instance, dc) group_left()` is an important aspect of how the alert combines data from different metrics. Let's break this down:

Here's the explanation:

1. Purpose of the operation:  
   The `* on (meta_instance, dc) group_left()` operation is used to join two different metrics while controlling how labels are combined and preserved.

2. Breaking it down:

    - `*`: This is a multiplication operation, but in this context, it's being used to join metrics.
    - `on (meta_instance, dc)`: This specifies which labels should be used to match rows between the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the operation.
    - `group_left()`: This indicates that for each matching row on the right side, we want to keep all the labels from the left side.

3. Why it's necessary:

    - The left side of this operation (the full GC count metric) has more labels (including `k8s_pod`) than the right side (the heap usage metrics).
    - Without `group_left()`, Prometheus would drop the `k8s_pod` label because it's not present in both metrics being joined.
    - We want to keep the `k8s_pod` label because it's crucial for identifying which specific frontend node is experiencing the heap spike.

4. How it affects the result:

    - This operation ensures that the resulting alert retains the `k8s_pod` label from the full GC count metric.
    - It allows the alert to provide pod-specific information, which is essential for troubleshooting and directing the response to the correct node.

5. Comparison to the previous version:
    - If we didn't use `group_left()`, we might lose the ability to pinpoint which specific pod is experiencing the heap spike.
    - The previous version might have aggregated data across all pods, making it harder to identify and respond to issues on specific nodes.

In essence, `* on (meta_instance, dc) group_left()` allows us to combine the full GC count information (which is pod-specific) with the heap usage information (which might be at a higher level) in a way that preserves the pod-level granularity. This makes the alert more precise and actionable, as it can tell you exactly which pod is experiencing a heap spike, rather than just that there's a problem somewhere in the cluster.

This change is crucial for the accuracy and usefulness of the alert, enabling more targeted and efficient responses to heap spike issues.

```
Increase Percentage = 100 * (
  (4294967296 + 1.2 * max(heap usage over 28 days) - min(heap memory))
  /
  min(heap memory)
)
```

```
Percentage Increase = 100 * (
  (4 + 1.2 * (max(heap usage over 28 days) / 1024^3) - (current heap limit / 1024^3))
  /
  (current heap limit / 1024^3)
)
```
