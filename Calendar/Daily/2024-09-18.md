# Wednesday - September 18th 2024

I agree that reconciliation times should be significantly shorter. In testing, Varsamis and I have observed it taking 20 to 25 minutes between nodes, though in some cases as little as five minutes. On average, rolling out changes to a standard 4-node cluster takes about an hour. We should aim to reduce the time between reconciliations to 10-30 seconds.

When reproducing a similar issue, Nicolas and I consistently saw ~20-minute delays between operator adjustments. The first reconciliation happens immediately, but subsequent checks are delayed. I’ve only tested on non-production clusters, but I believe the issue exists in OCI as well. The delay may feel more noticeable in colos, especially during tasks like reverting Express versions.

I'll provide instructions for reproducing this issue, though times may vary. I'll also share a pull request based on previous research—please feel free to dismiss it if it's not relevant.
