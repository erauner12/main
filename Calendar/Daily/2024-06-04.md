# Tuesday - June 4th 2024

What about like the case that what if whenever we present that button from the SRA router perspective and when you respond to it, instead of responding directly with a modal for a task, like, what if the assumption is we don't know exactly which task we want, like, we want to offer like some option, some generic option of which task to execute? Would, like, would you be able to seamlessly like, like offer like a, you know, let's say two to three options, and then based on which option then to redirect them to this modal like that would be the entry point to the task or no? Well, yes, but my question is whether it makes sense, right? If we have, you know, if we have this kind of context help when someone mentions provisioner, right? So suppose that, you know, an alert is received. Yeah. And we don't know what kind of action we want to, we want to perform, whether it's a just heap or bounce node or, you know, maybe something else. Then does it really make sense to try to offer like three buttons or, you know, list of actions that you want to do? Or is it enough for the user to submit a proper command, whether, you know, whenever they are ready or whenever they are sure it's this kind of task that they want to submit in this case? Yeah, like the use case I have in mind was for that unplanned GC, which I've been trying to kind of create a separation of, okay, this is always just heap and this is always bounce, but it's not so straightforward. It's, yeah. So it's like, I want to, I wanted just ability, like, since we know, like every time for unplanned GC, that is either going to be a bounce or an adjust heap that we would be able to satisfy that. So, but I think most, most alerts, like by definition of the alert, we should know exactly what it's supposed to do. And that one thing is that that's going to be most, I would say most of the alerts should be that. Or maybe we could have some kind of generic response, right? Or maybe we could have some kind of generic response, right? Suppose that we receive an alert and what the, you know, in this first phase, maybe what's enough for the SRE router to do is instead of trying to offer buttons or do something, some advanced logic, maybe it would be enough to mention the provisioner, right? Because that's going to generate the help for the user. Oh, just, oh, oh, I see. You're just saying prompt them to do an app provisioner. No, the SRE router would just mention the provisioner, add provisioner in the thread, which is going to automatically generate the response from the Slack handler. And whoever comes in will, will have the ready, you know, context help what they could do about that alert. In that case, we don't need to have an integration with the SRE bot, right? We're just going to handle the request from the Slack channel. That's it. Well, well, that's another case. If we, if we need integration with SRE bot, meaning that we want to generate EEQ based on that alert. That's another story, right? Because, you know, we.

in the alert, like the instance name and the heap that I'm going to be adjusting this instance to? So I've been working on that. OK. Sorry, go ahead. I'll tell you after, my bad. OK, I was just about to finish. Is it like all these kind of pieces of information, is it somewhere hidden in the alert? I mean, the instance name, the amount of heap? Or is it just up to me to go through the internals of the alert and basically supply the values to the modal window, like myself? Yeah, so from the alert perspective, what I've been working on just is trying to figure out, OK, what I already know that I can get pretty easily is the instance name, the node name, basically the target. And what I've been trying to do is see if I can get these values alongside the target that are useful, like the suggested value for the heap and this and that. But then I've run into, OK, if I need to do that, then I need to create a recording rule. So it's kind of like it's introducing this additional strain to creating an alert, which is already kind of a pain, which makes me think, well, we already have the most important thing, which is the value of the thing that's happening. So from the perspective of SRE Router, because we own this layer, we could just take, we can let the alerts be as simple as possible, only supply us the value of the target. And then any other additional ancillary information, such as what is the suggested value for the heap of this cluster, like from Consys, we can resolve that via a query directly to PROM. We can resolve that. All we need is the target. And then it's just one API request, bang, we have it. And then that's what we, I guess, thinking about the flow, that's what I would want to supply to you somehow. I don't really know what way you'd prefer it. I was thinking in the form of hiding it in the button. But if there's something else you can think of that would be better, that's what I was thinking. There is the only way. It's really utilize the properties of the button. As I showed you here, let me show you the screen again. This is all we have, right? Hey, guys. Hey, Mark Simons. Hey, Mark Simons.

Agree on a structure of the json object

---

So we need to be very careful and like demand like at least like a couple of parameters to be defined or else we There is a problem like that we can We can match much things that we shouldn't be like so you're saying if we if if we don't enforce it Then some if someone's too greedy with their yes Then yeah, you can break others like it can much anything. Yeah Yeah, I didn't I didn't think of that I didn't think that there was any like relationship between One like let's say one alert would be able to prevent another. Yeah, look because like if Example the problem is the rules, right? The definitions of the rules because like if you if you go and Lose you can go with like it's it's a big like yeah, just one comment. Yeah. Yeah. Should I reapprove the

1. Analyzing the last 7 days:

    ```
    python3 script.py --days 7
    ```

    - Rationale: Looking at a shorter time frame, such as the last 7 days, can help you identify recent significant changes or spikes in heap usage. This can be useful for detecting sudden or unexpected increases in heap consumption that may require immediate attention.
    - Benefits: By focusing on a shorter time frame, you can quickly identify clusters that have experienced significant changes in the past week, allowing you to prioritize your investigation and take prompt action if needed.

2. Analyzing the last 60 days:

    ```
    python3 script.py --days 60
    ```

    - Rationale: Extending the analysis to a longer time frame, such as the last 60 days, can provide a broader perspective on the heap usage trends of the clusters. This can help you identify clusters that have been consistently experiencing high heap usage or gradual increases over a longer period.
    - Benefits: Analyzing a longer time frame allows you to detect clusters that may have been consistently operating close to their heap capacity limits. This information can be valuable for capacity planning and proactively adding heap to clusters before they reach critical levels.

3. Analyzing a specific cluster:

    ```
    python3 script.py --days 30 --cluster <cluster-name>
    ```

    - Rationale: If you have a particular cluster of interest or a cluster that has been flagged for high heap usage, you can use the `--cluster` flag to focus the analysis on that specific cluster. This can help you investigate the heap usage patterns and significant changes for that cluster in detail.
    - Benefits: By targeting a specific cluster, you can gain insights into its unique heap usage behavior, identify any notable spikes or changes, and make informed decisions about adding heap specifically for that cluster.

4. Analyzing with a different time window:

    ```
    python3 script.py --days 30 --window 6h
    ```

    - Rationale: The `--window` flag allows you to specify the time window for calculating the maximum heap usage over a given period. By default, it is set to `1h` (1 hour). Adjusting the time window to a larger value, such as `6h` (6 hours), can help smooth out short-term fluctuations and provide a more stable view of the heap usage trends.
    - Benefits: Using a larger time window can help mitigate the impact of temporary spikes or outliers in the heap usage data. It provides a more balanced perspective on the overall heap usage patterns and can help you make more informed decisions about adding heap based on sustained high usage rather than short-term peaks.

5. Suppressing clusters with no significant changes:
    ```
    python3 script.py --days 30 --suppress-no-changes
    ```
    - Rationale: When you have a large number of clusters, the output can become cluttered with information about clusters that have not experienced any significant changes in heap usage. By using the `--suppress-no-changes` flag, you can focus the output on only the clusters that have significant changes.
    - Benefits: Suppressing clusters with no significant changes streamlines the output and allows you to quickly identify the clusters that require attention. It helps you prioritize your analysis and decision-making process by highlighting the clusters that have experienced notable heap usage changes.

These are just a few examples of how you can use the script with different flag values to gain valuable insights into heap usage patterns and make informed decisions about adding heap to clusters. Feel free to experiment with different combinations of flags and values based on your specific requirements and the characteristics of your environment.
