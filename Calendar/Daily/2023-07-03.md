Imagine having a spreadsheet that displayed how much attention you ve invested in any given area of your life.  
Mind, body, spirit, and business that impact your relationship with the world and those around you. The spreadsheet would be a direct indicator of your quality of life.

Noticed the way I essentially noticed a thought

Instead of letting you start, B something I take as truth. It was something that I was able to notice
