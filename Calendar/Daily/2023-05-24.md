# 2023-05-24

Week: [[2023-W21]]  
Was today a good day?

- Generally, would you say today was good or no?

wtagd:: it was not terrible but I was not productive at work. Let myself be distracted optimizing Todoist. Though I feel I really needed to. To help me be able to be more consistent moving forward

---

What excited me?

- What excited you today?

**wem**:: it excites me to work on to my Todoist filters. I’m starting to have a semblance of what I’ve always wanted. A a system to help me bounce back when I fall off.

---

What drained me of energy?

- Did you spin your wheels on anything

doe:: working out. But not in a bad way. I am extremely tired right now and I think that might actually be a good thing.

---

What have I learned?

- Did you learn anything?

whil:: I learned that the new dog park coming in September will have some kind of social system that tells your friends when your dog is there.

---

What am I grateful for?

- What are you grateful for?

gf:: grateful to have a buddy like Bryan to keep inviting me out to things even though I’m not particularly consistent about showing up. It’s nice to have someone who won’t give up on you.

---

How did I push the needle forward?

pn:: I pushed forward on my productivity system. I pushed forward also at the gym by starting again after being off for 12 days. It’s all about starting again.
