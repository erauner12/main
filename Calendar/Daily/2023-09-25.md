To make sure that somebody hasn't already done this, I think they have. I just don't think it's open source. So the goal is to build a, this is not user-facing. This is all dev-facing, whatever. Build some kind of an interface to receive XML files. And the unique ID, like the unique identifier is a phone number. Each text message has a phone number associated with it. So the goal of the model would be to be able to accept a few sentences and essentially convert it into, I guess, like the, what's the word? Essentially translate it into how the person who belongs to the phone number texts, typically. So you know how some people text in lowercase and they use no punctuation and some people use the U instead of Y-O-U? Essentially the goal would be to translate just any sort of sentence input and convert it into how the person speaks. Okay. And what were you saying about an XML file? So the data that you would be provided to train the model would be an XML file. Oh, okay, I see. And in the model, so basically given a set of data, the associated So we would like, you know, take the data inside the XML file and, you know, turn it, yeah, I would want to like write a script. And the other thing too is we want to tokenize the phone numbers because we don't need the phone numbers being in there. So instead of having a phone number, you would just have either a fake name or just probably just an ID essentially or something like that or a descriptor for how the texting sounds. I think probably having a fake name would be better. Okay. Because each like text, each response is going to have like its own kind of like tone, you know what I mean? Like I have like a few friends that don't talk like anybody else in my phone. Like they have a very distinctive way of like texting. What is being asked by, what is being, what is prompting the person to send this data in a text message? What are they sending? Oh, okay, so the entire goal is that this is going to be used for building out game dialogue essentially as a text message. So the game involves text messages. That's all I can say really. Okay. Essentially it's for the person that's building the dialogue for the NPC to be able to quickly convert like some sentence into the way that the NPC would talk. And each NPC would have its own like data model basically. So it just makes it a lot easier. The other thing too is if you want to generate, like the next step would be to actually generate the dialogue, but I have less interest in that because I want there to be a human storyteller essentially, so I don't think generating an AI conversation is like all that interesting. But like capturing the way that somebody speaks, like and the thing is that this game is going to be very expansive and so it will require like, I don't know, maybe thousands of text messages per game. Does that make sense? So any number of, so if I don't have to think about tone when I'm writing for each response where I can at least have it like start from somewhere where I'm like, I just type in the sentence of what I want the NPC to say and then it converts it into like the way that that NPC would talk. You see what I'm saying? It like saves me having to think about tone. And then the next step too can be like when you start to like, if you start to generate text, then you have it, it's almost like a behavior of sorts, you know what I'm saying? That I'm trying to capture within like the data model. Okay. Yeah. I think, I guess I've got 10 years of text messages. So, that's what's in the XML file. Yeah. So these, yeah, yeah. Okay. So the data in the XML file, probably longer, actually probably 20 years. Wow. I felt like every text went back to like 2009. What are the text messages? They're just, just communications between me and my friends essentially. So, but I think, you know, like training the model to essentially be able to generate text or apply a tone to a set of text. That's really what I care about for phase one. Now, I know, I think that Google or Apple or somebody is already doing this because, you know, whenever you, you're on your like, especially if you have like a smartwatch or whatever, if somebody texts, you can auto reply with a selected message. They're now setting it up to where it puts it in your voice for how you normally would reply. Oh, Yeah. So, so doing what we're exactly what we're doing, but this, but the goal is so that the NPC is able to know, like know, based on your input, what, what is it? Well, so I guess, so the NPC, this, this is just the tool for the person that's writing the message for me. Does that make sense? At this point, that's the way to think about it. So like, because, because it's not that it's, it's for the game developer, right? So, so, so just to give you an example, like if I text you and I use a capital I and I use everything's lowercase, perfect sentence structure, no typos, period on the end, very clean, like basically like, what do they call it? Like the citations or whatever. I, the goal would be for me to take that sentence and then convert it to, and to something, have somebody else talk into something more. Yeah. So you, like you're saying like 10 to 20 years worth of messages might, and like all of these are somewhat, you know, like this sample data or not sample the data in the XML. This is all jumbled up, right? Like, yeah, I mean, it's true. It's just, it's, it's not jumbled up. It's each message has a phone number attached to it. So the phone number is the, or every message that's sent has the phone number. Okay. And maybe if there's situations where somebody's phone number has changed, like we can account for that when we clean the data. But the goal would be to take that, build a model and then for each number and then train and then have it, have the model apply the way that the person talks your texts rather to a sentence that you give essentially. Does that make sense? Think of it like, like translating English to Spanish, but instead of it being Spanish, it's, it's like the tonality, like. Yeah. So, okay. This number, this person has this town, this number, this person has this town. Yes. Yeah. It's basically trend. It's like, it's like a translator, but it's like a, instead of it being like English to Spanish, it's like English to, or it's like, it's like my tone or any, any tone that you put into something else. Does that make sense? I think so. Yeah, I guess I would have to, do you have any, do you have like a documentation on this specific thing? Like, or like a, or is it just at this point, just like that? I, an idea that you're, this is, this is an idea. Yeah. So I don't, so basically the game is like, I've already got it architected, like the way that we're storing everything, but it, but the AI portion is like the tooling and stuff for building the storytelling of the game. It's like, like it's clean slate at this point. So this is a tool to help build the storytelling. Yes. It's a tool for, for somebody to be able to generate a dialogue, essentially, and have it be in line with what NPC, like the way that they would talk. Does that make sense? I believe so. I believe so. But what I still don't necessarily understand is the, the mapping of the number to, and how that relates to an NPC. So number, so one individual unique number has, is going to have, you know, a list of messages from going back, you know, 20 years. And, and, and, you know, we want to, that needs to be, there needs to be like, I guess a mapping somehow of what tone, the aggregate amount of messages. If you train the model, that would be its own. You would keep the data separated. You see what I'm saying? So like, you might have 20 models, one for each phone number. Yeah. You know what I mean? Well, that's what I don't, I don't know yet. Would that be necessary to have a model for each? I think so, because I think you'd have to, because I think if you, your, the data would be contaminated. And like, you'd have to separate, the model by each one. And my goal, I say that, unless you can tell it compartmentalize this data, and then, you have to keep it separated somehow. And that's, that's what I had to investigate on my own, since I haven't really done. But I feel as if you could train it with examples. So like, this is, this is how Martha talks. And then you, so anytime you say, okay, take this sentence and, and give it back to me in the way that Martha would talk. I feel like, I feel like you'd almost want a separate system to, to hold what, okay, that number is somebody. And yeah, you could, you could clean that data before it even goes into the AI. So you could call it like you can use for your gods or something like that, instead of man, because that's pretty common in like it. So you'd say like Apollo or whatever, and then Apollo, you would train Apollo with one phone number. And then you would, then you do like one for Thor and you train Thor with a different phone number or something like that. But I mean, basically the way that we would capture the tonality is I would probably have my own personal sheet of like who each person is like in reality, because I know, like I know who they are. And like, I'll remember what they sound like, but, but like we would have a descriptor for like the name. So we would always, we would say like, I don't know, all of us, like, instead of saying like, sounds good and using like corporate kind of talk, they would just say, okay. Or, or dot, dot, dot. Okay. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. There's like, there's like a lot of times there's like 30 different ways to say the same thing. So like some of my friends will reply with like, Oh, so, so another thing I wanted to ask, so this is this, whatever it is that it's only, are we only doing this for a batch, the batch that is the XML file? Like the, or is this a needing a continued, this needs to be an interface that is continually like added to like be a text message. So, so the thing that I would say is that, you know, at some point somebody is going to build. So the way that this game is going to work, it's going to be a platform. So people will be able to write their own stories inside of it. And so they'll be able to build stories. So we'll probably have it able to read data sets that somebody has put together. Manually will be, but the format will be the same. It'll basically be a name or some unique identifier. And then a bunch of, a bunch of text blocks. So, so yes, the answer is this isn't going to be one time use. This will be used indefinitely. Okay. So, but, but we still need the admin pane or builder or whatever for the person that's building the story. Essentially. Okay. It'll probably be stored in Jason or something like that, but I haven't got through the logistics of that yet, but essentially the goal for now, I mean, at some point it would be cool to have, have the game, have the game, like build its own story. Right. And then like play through that. But I just don't know if that would be engaging at this point, but that would be like next level. Yeah. That'd be something where, you know, I'd be interested in doing it, but that would be like, if we can make this work and I would be interested in like using AI to actually like build a game. Yeah. But for now, all I'm trying to do is just capture the tonality. From a, from somebody with a phone number. Yeah. I mean, you can even do this for a book or something like that, but the problem is. So say you have like 10 messages from one person with a phone number. What, what would be an example of what you would like ideally want to capture like a prompt? Like, you know, evaluate what the messages like are, you know, understand what, what the tone is of said messages and how the output is. What is, Hey, this person talks like this. I mean, so I don't understand enough about like, so I think it may be something like the journey. I don't know where you, so like the way that that journey works is you feed it an input. Yeah. Very similar outputs, but, but, but you can color those outputs with the description. Does that make sense? And so the description, the text is the description and it's coloring the output of the sentence structure or whatever. So like, I don't know, maybe it would give you multiple options. You can choose from like four for instance, where so, so I, so I say, I was like, basically I'm like, hello, hello is a greeting. I don't know if the data, the data model, I don't know if it would just inherently know that based off of, I don't know. I don't, there may be an existing data model that you have to like piggyback off of to be able to do something like this. But like, instead of saying hello, so like, how's it going? Like depending on like the data model, you know what I mean? I don't know if that, I don't quite, I feel like, is there like already this being done like manually somehow or now? Like what, what we're talking about? No, I've not built any of this stuff. This is, this is just an idea, but like, I know that, I know it's possible because somehow Apple or Google, it's one of the companies is using, has a data model that can work. They can like reply in your tone of voice. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how they're doing it. The first thing I would do would be to look online to see if there's been research and this has already been done, because I feel like it probably has. I feel like, yeah, I feel like, but there's multiple components of this, it seems, that, that are likely is one, a model that is, is trained in a certain way or it's already been trained and you're just, you know, giving it a prompt and a different system is keeping track of like different profiles of people. And, because think about Spanish to English, it somehow knows what the meaning of the word is. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, but you didn't, you didn't need it. I don't think you need to train that if you're just using something that already exists. Do you? I guess what I'm, what I don't understand is yet is what, what would be unique that you would want to train this model to understand that it would not already understand. Well, I mean, as of right now, like, I don't know, maybe this model just exists off the shelf, but I just need, all I know is, I don't know what it looks like because I haven't gotten into the weeds that far. I just basically just need something that I can give an input. It translates it to the way a person texts and then gives, gives either one output or like a set of, a set of, okay, but yeah, beyond that, I have no, I kind of, I feel like, I feel like this could be accomplished probably without even having to train anything because, I'm not, I want to know how to, how to speak. I guess it depends on what we're, if we are going to use the Chassis BT API or like something. Yeah. Because if that's the case, then I feel like you'd be able to just provide a prompt. And, but in that, in that risk request, you would also have to provide it with like inside of the prompt, some information specific to that user, which a different system would likely be holding. Like, you know. That would be where the XML file is. Yeah. Yeah. Like in that request, it contains, you know, all right, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. All right. It's kind of like you are the doctor, but instead of it being a doctor it's some arbitrary person, and then we feed her the data so that it gives us the output. I think so. I don't, yeah, so that's, that's a fine solution for me, man.


---


Like it's not something that needs to be live, does that make sense? Yeah, I guess that makes it, that would make it easier for the time being, like. Probably what I would do is I would give you one phone number and one data set to start with essentially, and then you know. And then based on these messages from this phone number, something, it has to have some kind of result. And what that result is, I don't know. I have a set of four results here. What do you mean a set of four results? Like four different ways to say hi to this person would normally, like how Mint Journey gives you four options. Well, yeah, but that wouldn't, wouldn't that be what is coming back from the API, the four, but I'm saying, what would the input be from. Thousands and thousands of text messages, basically. Oh, you're so, you're okay. Okay. I mean, we're basically teaching it a language in a way, I guess, and then the language is the way the person talks. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. I'd have to look into it. Well, again, I've never fucked with anything like this before, so I would just have to fuck with it to understand. You know, I don't really know shit. But you at least understand like the ask, right? Like you understand what I'm trying to accomplish. A little bit, but I think once you provide me more information, like hopefully like in a, you know, like a video of the process or a text, you know, a document that's just walking through the thing, that wouldn't be helpful. You know? Well, okay. So how about I draw it out for you? Yeah. Okay. So how about I draw it out for you? Yeah.
