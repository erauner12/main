# Atomic Note Refinement System

I think it could be nice to have a system for refining what I want to say or include in a note so that when I create it, it will be as fleshed out as possible and, therefore, valuable. Whenever I see it again, if I do, I won't have to put much more effort into it than just letting my stream of consciousness take over as I take the note, whether it is from my phone or from here. I won't lose the note because it will be stored in drafts. I believe this will really help with creating atomic notes, and I'm looking forward to seeing the results.
