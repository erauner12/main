# Preparing for What You Want

## Not Feeling Ready

> I don't feel ready for what I want

//note

//todo


## Understanding the Process

- Focus on general feelings, not specifics
- Avoid:
    - "Loading the truck and going"
    - Identifying specific people
    - Manipulation/orchestration
    - Goal setting

## The Vortex Concept

- Ideal relationship exists in the vortex
- Details will unfold naturally
- No need to understand everything now
- Trust in the process is essential


## Vibrational Preparation

- Key challenge: preparing vibrationally to receive
- Normal to feel fear/not ready
- If not manifested yet = not ready yet
- Acknowledgment of unreadiness is positive

## Important Notes

- Trust the content of your vortex
- Allow natural unfolding
- Focus on vibrational alignment
- Accept current state of readiness
