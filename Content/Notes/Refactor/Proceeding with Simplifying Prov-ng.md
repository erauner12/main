# Proceeding with Simplifying Prov-ng

**1. Extract Common Monitoring Logic:**

- **Create a `KubernetesMonitor` Mixin or Utility Class:**
    - This class can encapsulate the logic for setting up the Kubernetes client, initiating the watch stream, and handling events.
    - By using a mixin, you allow any step that requires monitoring to inherit this functionality without affecting the existing inheritance hierarchy.

**Example Structure:**

```
# lib/monitor_utils.py

import logging
from kubernetes import watch
from kubernetes.client import ApiException

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class KubernetesMonitor:
    def setup(self):
        """Set up Kubernetes client and watch."""
        self.kubeconfig = self._kubeconfig  # Provided by the base class
        self.k8s = K8SClient(self.run_dc, self.dc(), self.kubeconfig)
        self.k8s.connect()
        self.watch = watch.Watch()

    def teardown(self):
        """Clean up Kubernetes resources."""
        if self.watch:
            self.watch.stop()
        if self.k8s:
            self.k8s.close()

    def monitor_pod_status(self, namespace, pod_name, timeout_seconds=600):
        """Monitor the status of a Kubernetes pod."""
        # Implement the watch logic here
        pass
```

**2. Refactor `MecBounceNode` to Use the Shared Monitor:**

- **Inherit or Include the `KubernetesMonitor`:**
    - Modify `bounce_node_abstract.py` or the specific steps to include `KubernetesMonitor`.
- **Remove Redundant Monitoring Code:**
    - Replace any direct implementations of the Kubernetes watch pattern with calls to the shared methods.

**3. Identify and Extract Other Shared Functionalities:**

- **Slack Notification Methods:**
    - If Slack notifications are used across multiple tasks, consider creating a `SlackNotificationMixin`.
    - This mixin can handle sending messages, formatting, and any other Slack-related utilities.

**Example:**

```
# lib/notification_utils.py

class SlackNotificationMixin:
    def notify_slack(self, message, message_type="info", details=None, update_ts=None):
        """Send notification to Slack."""
        # Implement Slack notification logic
        pass
```

- **Step State Updates:**
    - If updating the step state is a common operation, you might encapsulate this in a utility method or mixin as well.
    - Ensure that this utility respects the state management practices of your application.

**4. Keep the Codebase Decoupled Yet Simple:**

- **Use Composition Over Inheritance Where Appropriate:**
    - While mixins are helpful, overusing inheritance can lead to a complex hierarchy.
    - Consider using utility functions or composition to include shared functionality without complicating the class structure.
- **Modularize Utilities:**
    - Group related utilities into modules like `monitor_utils.py`, `notification_utils.py`, etc.
    - This organization makes the codebase easier to navigate and understand.

**5. Review Other Tasks for Similar Patterns:**

- **Audit `MECAdjustHeap`, `MECDeployClusters`, etc.:**
    - Look for code that duplicates the monitoring or notification logic.
    - Refactor these tasks to use the shared utilities.

**6. Update Documentation and Guidelines:**

- **Document the Shared Utilities:**
    - Provide clear docstrings and usage examples for the new utility classes and methods.
    - This helps other developers understand how to use them correctly.

**7. Test Thoroughly:**

- **Ensure Backward Compatibility:**
    - Verify that existing functionality in `MecBounceNode` and other tasks remains unaffected after the refactoring.
    - Write unit tests for the shared utilities if they don't exist already.

**8. Engage with Your Coworker:**

- **Propose the Changes:**
    - Prepare a summary of the proposed refactoring, highlighting the benefits.
    - Share examples of how the new utilities simplify the code in `MecBounceNode`.
- **Discuss Naming and Organization:**
    - Collaborate on appropriate names for the shared modules and methods to ensure they accurately reflect their purpose.

**Example of Refactored `MecBounceNode` Usage:**

```python
# prov_platform/mec/MecBounceNode/bounce_node_abstract.py

from lib.monitor_utils import KubernetesMonitor
from lib.notification_utils import SlackNotificationMixin

class BounceNodeAbstract(KubernetesMonitor, SlackNotificationMixin, AbstractStepMec):
    def __init__(self, step_args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(step_args, **kwargs)
        # Existing initialization code



    # Other methods
**Avoid Overcomplicating:**

- **Balance Between DRY and Clarity:**
  - While it's important to eliminate code duplication, ensure that the abstraction doesn't make the code harder to understand.
  - Only extract code that is truly shared and unlikely to diverge among tasks.

- **Minimize Inheritance Depth:**
  - Deep inheritance hierarchies can become difficult to manage.
  - Limit the number of parent classes or consider using composition.

**Conclusion:**

By extracting the Kubernetes monitoring logic and other shared functionalities into separate utilities or mixins, you can keep the codebase clean and maintainable. This approach promotes reuse and simplifies future enhancements. Remember to collaborate with your team to ensure that the changes align with the overall design principles and project goals.
