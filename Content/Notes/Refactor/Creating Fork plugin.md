# Creating Fork plugin

I want to create a simple Obsidian plugin that performs one function. If you’re familiar with an app called Fork on Mac, which is a Git client, I would like to develop a plugin that opens Fork. For example, while using Git within my Obsidian repository, I want to use the command palette or a shortcut to trigger a command that opens Fork for the specific file. If that’s not possible, I’d like it to open Fork for the repository that the vault is currently in. That’s essentially what I want to achieve.


A little better than before I suppose
