Iterating on Initial Prompts with Drafts

I believe this process could be useful because the most significant part of defining something lies in its initial stages. When you first have an idea, it seems straightforward if you view it as a single concept. However, if ideas are constantly flowing in from all directions, it can become overwhelming. This makes it challenging to dedicate the same level of effort to each idea as you would to any other task.

For instance, if I want to complete something and create a Jira ticket, it might actually take less time than drafting the ticket itself. Whatâ€™s crucial is to define what I am doing, why I am doing it, the impact it will have, and what constitutes the definition of done. That is what I consider important.
